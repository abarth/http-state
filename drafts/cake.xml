    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>HTTP does not provide servers with a robust mechanism for tracking
      state between requests.  The dominant HTTP state management mechanism
      in use on the Internet, known as cookies, has a number of historical
      infelicities that impair its security and privacy.  In particular,
      cookies have the following serious defects:
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>Cookies assume that a given host name trusts all of its
        superdomains and siblings.  In particular, students.example.edu can
        manipulate the cookies used by grades.example.edu, potentially
        resulting in security vulnerabilities.</t>

        <t>Cookies provide no integrity protection against active network
        attackers.  Even if the example.com HTTP server always employs TLS,
        a network attacker manipulate the server's cookies by spoofing
        responses to requests for http://example.com (assuming the user
        agent makes a single non-TLS HTTP request, which, of course, the
        attacker can redirect to http://example.com).</t>

        <t>Cookies indicate only which user agent issued a given HTTP
        request.  They provide no information about why the user agent
        issued that request.  This design flaw leads many HTTP servers to be
        vulnerable to cross-site request forgery, in which the attacker
        tricks the honest server into performing an action on behalf of the
        user by causing the user agent to issue an HTTP request to the
        honest server with the user's cookies.</t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>This document defines a simple HTTP state management mechanism that
      addresses these shortcommings of cookies.  In this mechanism, the
      server stores a secret key at the user agent, called the cake-key.
      When the user agent issues subsequent HTTP requests to the server, the
      user agent sends a string, called a cake, containing a message
      authentication code (keyed by the cake-key) of the origin (see
      draft-abarth-origin) of the request.  By whitelisting acceptable
      cakes, the server can accept requests from origins of its choice,
      mitigating cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities.</t>

      <t>Unlike cookies, which can leak from one host name to another and
      from one scheme to another, the cake-key is scoped to the origin from
      which it was received.  In particular, http://students.example.edu and
      http://grades.example.edu have independent cake-keys.  Likewise,
      http://example.com and https://example.com have independent cake-keys.
      Therefore, a network attacker (who controls http://example.com) cannot
      manipulate the state for https://example.com.</t>

      <t>Cake, then, is a simple HTTP state management mechanism that
      resists a number of common attacks against previous mechanisms.</t>

        <t>The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
        NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
        interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

        <t>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such
        as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort
        these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word
        ("MUST", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.</t>

        <t>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps can
        be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent.
        In particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are

      <section anchor="syntax-notation" title="Syntax Notation">
        <t>This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
        notation of <xref target="RFC5234"/>.</t>

        <t>The following core rules are included by reference, as defined in
        <xref target="RFC5234"/>, Appendix B.1: ALPHA (letters), CR (carriage
        return), CRLF (CR LF), CTL (controls), DIGIT (decimal 0-9), DQUOTE
        (double quote), HEXDIG (hexadecimal 0-9/A-F/a-f), LF (line feed), OCTET
        (any 8-bit sequence of data), SP (space), HTAB (horizontal tab), CHAR
        (any US-ASCII character), VCHAR (any visible US-ASCII character), and
        WSP (whitespace).</t>

        <t>The OWS (optional whitespace) rule is used where zero or more
        linear whitespace characters MAY appear:
        <figure>
          <artwork type="abnf">
OWS            = *( [ obs-fold ] WSP )
                 ; "optional" whitespace
obs-fold       = CRLF
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        OWS SHOULD either not be produced or be produced as a single SP
        character.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
        <t>The terms user agent, client, server, proxy, and origin server have
        the same meaning as in the HTTP/1.1 specification (<xref
        target="RFC2616" />, Section 1.3).</t>

        <t>The terms request-host and request-uri refer to the values the user
        agent would send to the server as, respectively, the host (but not
        port) and the absoluteURI (http_URL) of the HTTP Request-Line.</t>

        <t>Two sequences of octets are said to case-insensitively match each
        other if and only if they are equivalent under the i;ascii-casemap
        collation defined in <xref target="RFC4790"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="overview" title="Overview">
      <t>The cake state managment mechanism consists of two HTTP headers, an
      HTTP response header named Set-Cake-Key and an HTTP request header
      named Cake.  The server can use the Set-Cake-Key response header to
      store a secret key at the user agent:
      <figure>
        <artwork type="abnf">
          <![CDATA[
set-cake-key-header = "Set-Cake-Key:" OWS set-cake-key-string OWS
set-cake-key-string = cake-key *( ";" SP cake-av )
cake-key            = 1*BASE64CHAR
BASE64CHAR          = ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "/" / "="
cake-av             = max-age-av / extension-av
max-age-av          = "Max-Age=" 1*DIGIT
extension-av        = <any CHAR except CTLs or ";">
          ]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      </t>

      <t>For example, the following header instructs the user agent to store
      a 128-bit secret key for two weeks:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
          <![CDATA[ 
Set-Cake-Key: 515BYea21GY7xRbZTLCekQ==; Max-Age=1209600
          ]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      </t>

      <t>Notice that the server can generate a base64 encoded random number
      easily using the openssl library:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
          <![CDATA[ 
$ openssl rand -base64 16
          ]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      </t>

      <t>The user agent then associated that cake-key with the
      security-origin it received the response from.  When making subsequent
      HTTP requests to that security-origin, the user agent includes the
      Cake request header:
      <figure>
        <artwork type="abnf">
          <![CDATA[
cake-header         = "Cake:" OWS cake OWS
cake                = 1*BASE64CHAR
          ]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      </t>

      <t>The Cake header contains a SHA-1 HMAC (keyed by the cake-key) of
      the security-origin that generated the request.  For example, if the
      request was generated on behalf of an HTML document from
      http://example.com, the user agent would send the following header:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
          <![CDATA[ 
Cake: Z32dI5wav1Cqj07ToG++DRXV18c=
          ]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      </t>

      <t>Notice that the server can generate the cake it will receive for
      various security-origins easily using the openssl library:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
          <![CDATA[ 
$ echo "Origin: http://example.com" |
  openssl dgst -hmac 515BYea21GY7xRbZTLCekQ== -sha1 -binary |
  openssl enc -base64
          ]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      </t>

      <t>By pre-computing the cake for the various security-origins the
      server expects to receive HTTP requests from, the server can whitelist
      those security-origins that have access to this "session".  Notice
      that if the server does not whitelist a particular origin (e.g.,
      http://attacker.com), the server will not link the incomming HTTP
      request with an existing session, making it difficult for the attacker
      to mount a cross-site request forgery attack.</t>

            <abstract> 
              <t>Until now, there has been no standard method for domain names
              to use characters outside the ASCII repertoire.  This document
              defines internationalized domain names (IDNs) and a mechanism
              called Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) for
              handling them in a standard fashion.  IDNs use characters drawn
              from a large repertoire (Unicode), but IDNA allows the non-ASCII
              characters to be represented using only the ASCII characters
              already allowed in so-called host names today.  This
              backward-compatible representation is required in existing
              protocols like DNS, so that IDNs can be introduced with no
              changes to the existing infrastructure.  IDNA is only meant for
              processing domain names, not free text. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t>

        <abstract> 
          <t>Punycode is a simple and efficient transfer encoding syntax
          designed for use with Internationalized Domain Names in Applications
          (IDNA). It uniquely and reversibly transforms a Unicode string into
          an ASCII string. ASCII characters in the Unicode string are
          represented literally, and non-ASCII characters are represented by
          ASCII characters that are allowed in host name labels (letters,
          digits, and hyphens). This document defines a general algorithm
          called Bootstring that allows a string of basic code points to
          uniquely represent any string of code points drawn from a larger
          set. Punycode is an instance of Bootstring that uses particular
          parameter values specified by this document, appropriate for
          IDNA.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a large character set called the
            Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the
            world's writing systems. The originally proposed encodings of
            the UCS, however, were not compatible with many current
            applications and protocols, and this has led to the development
            of UTF-8, the object of this memo. UTF-8 has the characteristic
            of preserving the full US-ASCII range, providing compatibility
            with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on
            US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values. This memo
            obsoletes and replaces RFC 2279.</t>
