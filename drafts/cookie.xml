      <t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie headers.
      These headers can be used by HTTP servers to store state on HTTP user
      agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the
      mostly stateless HTTP protocol.  The cookie protocol has many
      historical infelicities that degrade its security and privacy.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header. Using
      the Set-Cookie header, an HTTP server can store name/value pairs and
      associated metadata (called cookies) at the user agent. When the user
      agent makes subsequent requests to the server, the user agent uses the
      metadata to determine whether to return the name/value pairs in the
      Cookie header.</t>

      <t>Although simple on its surface, the cookie protocol has a number of
      complexities.  For example, the server indicates a scope for each
      cookie when sending them to the user agent.  The scope indicates the
      maximum amount of time the user agent should retain the cookie, to
      which servers the user agent should return the cookie, and for which
      protocols the cookie is applicable.</t>

      <t>For historical reasons, the cookie protocol contains a number of
      security and privacy infelicities.  For example, a server can indicate
      that a given cookie is intended for "secure" connections, but the
      Secure attribute provides only confidentiality (not integrity) from
      active network attackers.  Similarly, cookies for a given host are
      shared across all the ports on that host, even though the usual
      "same-origin policy" used by web browsers isolates content retrieved
      from different ports.</t>

        <t>This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
        notation of <xref target="RFC5234"/>.</t>

        <t>The following core rules are included by reference, as defined in
        <xref target="RFC5234"/>, Appendix B.1: ALPHA (letters), CR (carriage
        return), CRLF (CR LF), CTL (controls), DIGIT (decimal 0-9), DQUOTE
        (double quote), HEXDIG (hexadecimal 0-9/A-F/a-f), LF (line feed),
        OCTET (any 8-bit sequence of data), SP (space), HTAB (horizontal tab),
        VCHAR (any visible [USASCII] character), and WSP (whitespace).</t>

        <t>The OWS (optional whitespace) rule is used where zero or more
        linear whitespace characters may appear. OWS SHOULD either not be
        produced or be produced as a single SP character. Multiple OWS
        characters that occur within field-content SHOULD be replaced with a
        single SP before interpreting the field value or forwarding the
        message downstream.</t>

      <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
        <t>The terms user agent, client, server, proxy, and origin server have
        the same meaning as in the HTTP/1.1 specification (<xref
        target="RFC2616"/>).</t>

        <t>The terms request-host and request-URI refer to the values the user
        agent would send to the server as, respectively, the host (but not
        port) and abs_path portions of the absoluteURI (http_URL) of the HTTP
        Request-Line.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="overview" title="Overview">
      <t>We outline here a way for an origin server to send state
      information to a user agent, and for the user agent to return the
      state information to the origin server.</t>

      <t>To initiate a session, the origin server includes a Set-Cookie header
      in an HTTP response. (Note that "session" here does not refer to a
      persistent network connection but to a logical session created from HTTP
      requests and responses. The presence or absence of a persistent
      connection should have no effect on the use of cookie-derived
      sessions).</t>

      <t>The user agent returns a Cookie request header to the origin server
      if it chooses to continue a session. The Cookie header contains a number
      of cookies the user agent received in previous Set-Cookie headers. The
      origin server MAY ignore the Cookie header or use the header to
      determine the current state of the session. The origin server MAY send
      the user agent a Set-Cookie response header with the same or different
      information, or it MAY send no Set-Cookie header at all.</t>

      <t>Servers MAY return a Set-Cookie response header with any response.
      User agents SHOULD send a Cookie request header, subject to other rules
      detailed below, with every request.</t>

      <t>An origin server MAY include multiple Set-Cookie header fields in a
      single response. Note that an intervening gateway MUST NOT fold multiple
      Set-Cookie header fields into a single header field.</t>

      <t>If a server sends multiple responses containing Set-Cookie headers
      concurrently to the user agent (e.g., when communicating with the user
      agent over multiple sockets), these responses create a "race condition"
      that can lead to unpredictable behavior.</t>

      <section title="Examples">
        <t>Using the cookie protocol, a server can send the user agent a short
        string in an HTTP response that the user agent will return in future
        HTTP requests. For example, the server can send the user agent a
        "session identifier" named SID with the value 31d4d96e407aad42. The
        user agent then returns the session identifier in subsequent
        requests.</t>

          </artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>The server can alter the default scope of the cookie using the Path
        and Domain attributes. For example, the server can instruct the user
        agent to return the cookie to every path and every subdomain of
        example.com.</t>

            ]]>
          </artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>The server can store multiple cookies in the user agent. For
        example, the server can store a session identifier as well as the
        user's preferred language by returning two Set-Cookie response
        headers. Notice that the server uses the Secure and HttpOnly
        attributes to provide additional security protections for the
        more-sensitive session identifier.</t>

            ]]>
          </artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>If the server wishes the user agent to persist the cookie over
        multiple sessions, the server can specify a expiration date in the
        Expires attribute. Note that the user agent might might delete the
        cookie before the expiration date if the user agent's cookie store
        exceeds its quota or if the user manually deletes the server's
        cookie.</t>

          </artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Finally, to remove a cookie, the server returns a Set-Cookie header
        with an expiration date in the past. The server will be successful in
        removing the cookie only if the Path and the Domain attribute in the
        Set-Cookie header match the values used when the cookie was
        created.</t>

      support for some of the most esoteric aspects of the protocol.  User

          <t>The cookie-value is opaque to the user agent and MAY be
          anything the origin server chooses to send. "Opaque" implies that

          Set-Cookie header.</t>

          <t>To maximize compatibility with user agents, servers that wish to

          Some of these user agents might contain bugs that cause them process
          dates after the year 2038 incorrectly. Servers wishing to

        <section anchor="sane-set-cookie-semantics"
                 title="Semantics (Non-Normative)">
          <t>This section describes a simplified semantics of the Set-Cookie
          header. These semantics are detailed enough to be useful for
          understanding the most common uses of the cookie protocol. The full
          semantics are described in <xref target="cookie-protocol"
          />.</t>

          <t>When the user agent receives a Set-Cookie header, the user agent
          stores the cookie in its cookie store.  When the user agent
          subsequently makes an HTTP request, the user agent consults its
          cookie store and includes the applicable, non-expired cookies in the
          Cookie header.</t>

          <t>If the cookie store already contains a cookie with the same
          cookie-name, domain-value, and path-value, the existing cookie is
          evicted from the cookie store and replaced with the new value.
          Notice that servers can delete cookies by including an Expires
          attribute with a value in the past.</t>

          <t>Unless the cookie's attributes indicate otherwise, the cookie is
          returned only to the origin server, and it expires at the end of the
          current session (as defined by the user agent). User agents ignore
          unrecognized cookie attributes.</t>

          <section anchor="sane-expires" title="Expires">
            <t>The Expires attribute indicates the maximum lifetime of the
            cookie, represented as the date and time at which the cookie
            expires. The user agent is not required to retain the cookie
            until the specified date has passed. In fact, user agents often
            evict cookies from the cookie store due to memory pressure or
            privacy concerns.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sane-max-age" title="Max-Age">
            <t>The Max-Age attribute indicates the maximum lifetime of the
            cookie, represented as the number of seconds until the cookie
            expires. The user agent is not required to retain the cookie until
            the specified date has passed. In fact, user agents often evict
            cookies from the cookie store due to memory pressure or privacy
            concerns.
            <list>
              <t>WARNING: Not all user agents support the Max-Age attribute.
              User agents that do not support the Max-Age attribute will
              retain the cookie for the current session only.</t>
            </list>
            </t>

            <t>If a cookie has both the Max-Age and the Expires attribute, the
            Max-Age attribute has precedence and controls the expiration date
            of the cookie.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sane-domain" title="Domain">
            <t>The Domain attribute specifies those hosts for which the cookie
            will be sent. For example, if the Domain attribute contains the
            value ".example.com", the user agent will include the cookie in
            the Cookie header when making HTTP requests to example.com,
            www.example.com, and www.corp.example.com. (Note that a leading
            U+002E ("."), if present, is ignored.) If the server omits the
            Domain attribute, the user agent will return the cookie only to
            the origin server.
            <list>
              <t>WARNING: Some legacy user agents treat an absent Domain
              attribute as if the Domain attribute were present and contained
              the current host name. For example, if example.com returns a
              Set-Cookie header without a Domain attribute, these user agents
              will send the cookie to www.example.com.</t>
            </list>
            </t>

            <t>The user agent will reject cookies (refuse to store them in the
            cookie store) unless the Domain attribute specifies a scope for
            the cookie that would include the origin server. For example, the
            user agent will accept a Domain attribute of ".example.com" or of
            ".foo.example.com" from foo.example.com, but the user agent will
            not accept a Domain attribute of ".bar.example.com" or of
            ".baz.foo.example.com".</t>

            <t>NOTE: For security reasons, some user agents are configured to
            reject Domain attributes that do not correspond to a "registry
            controlled" domain (or a subdomain of a registry controlled
            domain). For example, some user agents will reject Domain
            attributes of ".com" or ".co.uk".</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sane-path" title="Path">
            <t>The Path attribute limits the scope of the cookie to a set of
            paths. When a cookie has a Path attribute, the user agent will
            include the cookie in an HTTP request only if the path portion of
            the Request-URI matches (or is a subdirectory of) the cookie's
            Path attribute, where the U+002F ("/") character is interpreted as a
            directory separator. If the server omits the Path attribute, the
            user agent will use the directory of the Request-URI's path
            component as the default value.</t>

            <t>Although seemingly useful for isolating cookies between
            different paths within a given domain, the Path attribute cannot
            be relied upon for security for two reasons: First, user agents do
            not prevent one path from overwriting the cookies for another
            path. For example, if a response to a request for /foo/bar.html
            attempts to set a cookie with a Path attribute of "/baz" the user
            agent will store that cookie in the cookie store. Second, the
            "same-origin" policy implemented by many user agents does not
            isolate different paths within an origin. For example,
            /foo/bar.html can read cookies with a Path attribute of "/baz"
            because they are within the "same origin".</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sane-secure" title="Secure">
            <t>The Secure attribute limits the scope of the cookie to "secure"
            channels (where "secure" is defined by the user agent). When a
            cookie has the Secure attribute, the user agent will include the
            cookie in an HTTP request only if the request is transmitted over
            a secure channel (typically TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/>).</t>

            <t>Although seemingly useful for protecting cookies from active
            network attackers, the Secure attribute protects only the cookie's
            confidentiality. An active network attacker can overwrite Secure
            cookies from an insecure channel, disrupting the integrity of the
            cookies.</t>

          agent. The cookie-name and the cookie-value are returned verbatim
          from the corresponding parts of the Set-Cookie header.</t>

          <t>Notice that the cookie attributes are not returned. In
          particular, the server cannot determine from the Cookie header alone
          when a cookie will expire, for which domains the cookie is valid,
          for which paths the cookie is valid, or whether the cookie was set
          with the Secure or HttpOnly attributes.</t>

          <t>The semantics of individual cookies in the Cookie header is not
          defined by this document. Servers are expected to imbue these
          cookies with server-specific semantics.</t>

          <t>Although cookies are serialized linearly in the Cookie header,
          servers SHOULD NOT rely upon the serialization order. In particular,
          if the Cookie header contains two cookies with the same name,
          servers SHOULD NOT rely upon the order in which these cookies appear
          in the header.</t>

        <t>Practical user agent implementations have limits on the number

        SHOULD provide each of the following minimum capabilities:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>At least 4096 bytes per cookie (as measured by the sum of the

        <t>Servers SHOULD use as few and as small cookies as possible to avoid
        reaching these implementation limits and to avoid network latency due
        to the Cookie header being included in every request.</t>

        <t>Servers should gracefully degrade if the user agent fails to return
        one or more cookies in the Cookie header because the user agent might
        evict any cookie at any time on orders from the user.</t>

      <section anchor="implementation-apis"
               title="Application Programmer Interfaces">
        <t>One reason the cookie protocol uses such an esoteric syntax is
        because many platforms (both in servers and user agents) provide
        string-based application programmer interfaces (APIs), requiring
        application-layer programmers to generate and parse the syntax used by
        the cookie protocol.</t>

        <t>Instead of providing string-based APIs to the cookie protocols,
        implementations would be well-served by providing more semantic APIs.
        It is beyond the scope of this document to recommend specific API

    <section anchor="privacy-considerations"
             title="Privacy Considerations">
        <t>The cookie protocol is often criticized for letting servers track
        users. For example, a number of "web analytics" companies use cookies
        to recognize when a user returns to a web site or visits another web
        site. Although cookies are not the only mechanism servers can use to
        track users across HTTP requests, cookies facilitate tracking because
        they are persistent across user agent sessions and can be shared
        between host names.</t>

        <section anchor="third-party-cookies" title="Third-Party Cookies">
          <t>Particularly worrisome are so-called "third-party" cookies. In
          rendering an HTML document, a user agent often requests resources
          from other servers (such as advertising networks). These third-party
          servers can use the cookie protocol to track the user even if the
          user never visits the server directly.</t>

          <t>Some user agents restrict how third-party cookies behave. For
          example, some user agents refuse to send the Cookie header in
          third-party requests. Other user agents refuse to process the
          Set-Cookie header in responses to third-party requests. Among user
          agents, there is a wide variety of third-party cookie policies. This
          document grants user agents wide latitude to experiment with
          third-party cookie policies that balance the privacy and
          compatibility needs of their users. However, this document does not
          endorse any particular third-party cookie policy.</t>

          <t>Third-party cookie blocking policies are often ineffective at
          achieving their privacy goals if servers attempt to work around
          their restrictions to track users. In particular, two collaborating
          servers can often track users without using cookies at all.</t>

        <section anchor="user-controls" title="User Controls">
          <t>User agents SHOULD provide users with a mechanism for managing
          the cookies stored in the cookie store. For example, a user agent
          might let users delete all cookies received during a specified time
          period or all the cookies related to a particular domain. In
          addition, many user agent include a user interface element that lets
          users examine the cookies stored in the cookie store.</t>

          <t>User agents SHOULD provide users with a mechanism for disabling
          cookies. When cookies are disabled, the user agent MUST NOT include
          a Cookie header in outbound HTTP requests and the user agent MUST
          NOT process Set-Cookie headers in inbound HTTP responses.</t>

          <t>Some user agents provide users the option of preventing
          persistent storage of cookies across sessions. When configured
          thusly, user agents MUST treat all received cookies as if the
          persistent-flag were set to false.</t>

          <t>Some user agents provide users with the ability to approve
          individual writes to the cookie store. In many common usage
          scenarios, these controls generate a large number of prompts.

      <section anchor="section-overview" title="Overview">
        <t>The cookie protocol has a number of security and privacy
        pitfalls.</t>

        <t>In particular, cookies encourage developers to rely on ambient
        authority for authentication, often creating vulnerabilities such as
        cross-site request forgery.  When storing session identifiers in
        cookies, developers often create session fixation
        vulnerabilities.</t>

        <t>Transport-layer encryption, such as that employed in HTTPS, is
        insufficient to prevent a network attacker from obtaining or altering a
        victim's cookies because the cookie protocol itself has various
        vulnerabilities (see "Weak Confidentiality" and "Weak Integrity",
        below). In addition, by default, the cookie protocol does not provide
        confidentiality or integrity from network attackers, even when used in
        conjunction with HTTPS.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="ambient-authority" title="Ambient Authority">
        <t>A server that uses cookies to authenticate users can suffer
        security vulnerabilities because some user agents let remote parties
        issue HTTP requests from the user agent (e.g., via HTTP redirects and
        HTML forms). When issuing those requests, user agent attaches cookies
        even if the entity does not know the contents of the cookies, possibly
        letting the remote entity exercise authority at an unwary server.</t>

        <t>Although this security concern goes by a number of names (e.g.,
        cross-site request forgery, confused deputy), the issue stems from
        cookies being a form of ambient authority. Cookies encourage server
        operators to separate designation (in the form of URLs) from
        authorization (in the form of cookies). Consequently, the user agent
        might supply the authorization for a resource designated by the
        attacker, possibly causing the server or its clients to undertake
        actions designated by the attacker as though they were authorized by
        the user.</t>

        <t>Instead of using cookies for authorization, server operators might
        wish to consider entangling designation and authorization by treating
        URLs as capabilities. Instead of storing secrets in cookies, this
        approach stores secrets in URLs, requiring the remote entity to supply
        the secret itself. Although this approach is not a panacea, judicious
        use of these principles can lead to more robust security.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="clear-text" title="Clear Text">
        <t>Unless sent over a secure channel (such as TLS), the information in
        the Set-Cookie and Cookie headers is transmitted in the clear.
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>All sensitive information conveyed in these headers is exposed to
          an eavesdropper.</t>

          <t>A malicious intermediary could alter the headers as they travel
          in either direction, with unpredictable results.</t>

          <t>A malicious client could alter the Cookie header before
          transmission, with unpredictable results.</t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <t>Servers SHOULD encrypt and sign the contents of cookies when
        transmitting them to the user agent (even when sending the cookies
        over a secure channel). However, encrypting and signing cookie
        contents does not prevent an attacker from transplanting a cookie from
        one user agent to another or from replaying the cookie at a later
        time.</t>

        <t>In addition to encrypting and signing the contents of every
        cookie, servers that require a higher level of security SHOULD use the
        cookie protocol only over a secure channel. When using the cookie
        protocol over a secure channel, servers SHOULD set the Secure
        attribute in every cookie. If a server does not set the Secure
        attribute, the protection provided by the secure channel will be
        largely moot.</t>

      <section anchor="session-identifiers" title="Session Identifiers">
        <t>Instead of storing session information directly in a cookie (where

        receives an HTTP request with a nonce, the server can look up state
        information associated with the cookie using the nonce as a key.</t>

        <t>Using session identifier cookies limits the damage an attacker can
        cause if the attacker learns the contents of a cookie because the
        nonce is useful only for interacting with the server (unlike non-nonce
        cookie content, which might itself be sensitive). Furthermore, using a
        single nonce prevents an attacker from "splicing" together cookie
        content from two interactions with the server, which could cause the
        server to behave unexpectedly.</t>

        <t>Using session identifiers is not without risk. For example, the
        server SHOULD take care to avoid "session fixation" vulnerabilities. A
        session fixation attack proceeds in three steps. First, the
        attacker transplants a session identifier from his or her user agent
        to the victim's user agent. Second, the victim uses that session
        identifier to interact with the server, possibly imbuing the session
        identifier with the user's credentials or confidential information.
        Third, the attacker uses the session identifier to interact with
        server directly, possibly obtaining the user's authority or
        confidential information.</t>

      <section anchor="weak-confidentiality" title="Weak Confidentiality">
        <t>Cookies do not provide isolation by port. If a cookie is readable
        by a service running on one port, the cookie is also readable by a
        service running on another port of the same server. If a cookie is
        writable by a service on one port, the cookie is also writable by a
        service running on another port of the same server. For this reason,
        servers SHOULD NOT both run mutually distrusting services on different
        ports of the same host and use cookies to store security-sensitive
        information.</t>

        <t>Cookies do not provide isolation by scheme. Although most commonly
        used with the http and https schemes, the cookies for a given host
        might also available to other schemes, such as ftp and gopher.
        Although this lack of isolation by scheme is most apparent in via
        non-HTTP APIs that permit access to cookies (e.g., HTML's
        document.cookie API), the lack of isolation by scheme is actually
        present in the cookie protocol itself (e.g., consider retrieving a URI
        with the gopher scheme via HTTP).</t>

        <t>Cookies do not always provide isolation by path. Although the
        network-level protocol does not send cookie stored for one path to
        another, some user agents expose cookies via non-HTTP APIs, such as
        HTML's document.cookie API. Because some of these user agents (e.g.,
        web browsers) do not isolate resources received from different paths,
        a resource retrieved from one path might be able to access cookies
        stored for another path.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="weak-integrity" title="Weak Integrity">
        <t>Cookies do not provide integrity guarantees for sibling domains
        (and their subdomains). For example, consider foo.example.com and
        bar.example.com. The foo.example.com server can set a cookie with a
        Domain attribute of ".example.com" (possibly overwriting an existing
        ".example.com" cookie set by bar.example.com), and the user agent will
        include that cookie in HTTP requests to bar.example.com. In the worst
        case, bar.example.com will be unable to distinguish this cookie from a
        cookie it set itself. The foo.example.com server might be able to
        leverage this ability to mount an attack against bar.example.com.</t>

        <t>Even though the cookie protocol supports the Path attribute, the
        Path attribute does not provide any integrity protection because the
        user agent will accept an arbitrary Path attribute in a Set-Cookie
        header. For example, an HTTP response to a request for
        http://example.com/foo/bar can set a cookie with a Path attribute of
        "/qux". Consequently, servers SHOULD NOT both run mutually distrusting
        services on different paths of the same host and use cookies store
        security sensitive information.</t>

        <t>An active network attacker can also inject cookies into the
        Cookie header sent to https://example.com/ by impersonating a response
        from http://example.com/ and injecting a Set-Cookie header. The HTTPS
        server at example.com will be unable to distinguish these cookies from
        cookies that it set itself in an HTTPS response. An active network
        attacker might be able to leverage this ability to mount an attack
        against example.com even if example.com uses HTTPS exclusively.</t>

        <t>Servers can partially mitigate these attacks by encrypting and
        signing the contents of their cookies. However, using cryptography
        does not mitigate the issue completely because an attacker can replay
        a cookie he or she received from the authentic example.com server in
        the user's session, with unpredictable results.</t>

        <t>Finally, an attacker might be able to force the user agent to
        delete cookies by storing large number of cookies. Once the user agent
        reaches its storage limit, the user agent will be forced to evict some
        cookies. Servers SHOULD NOT rely upon user agents retaining
        cookies.</t>

          <t>Punycode is a simple and efficient transfer encoding syntax
          designed for use with Internationalized Domain Names in Applications
          (IDNA). It uniquely and reversibly transforms a Unicode string into
          an ASCII string. ASCII characters in the Unicode string are
          represented literally, and non-ASCII characters are represented by
          ASCII characters that are allowed in host name labels (letters,
          digits, and hyphens). This document defines a general algorithm
          called Bootstring that allows a string of basic code points to
          uniquely represent any string of code points drawn from a larger
          set. Punycode is an instance of Bootstring that uses particular
          parameter values specified by this document, appropriate for
          IDNA.</t>

            <t>ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a large character set called the
            Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the
            world's writing systems. The originally proposed encodings of
            the UCS, however, were not compatible with many current
            applications and protocols, and this has led to the development
            of UTF-8, the object of this memo. UTF-8 has the characteristic
            of preserving the full US-ASCII range, providing compatibility
            with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on
            US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values. This memo
