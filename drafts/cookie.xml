    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The terms user agent, client, server, proxy, and origin server have
      the same meaning as in the HTTP/1.0 specification.</t>

      <t>Fully-qualified host name (FQHN) means either the fully-qualified
      domain name (FQDN) of a host (i.e., a completely specified domain name
      ending in a top-level domain such as .com or .uk), or the numeric
      Internet Protocol (IP) address of a host.
      <!-- TODO: The fully qualified domain name is preferred; use of numeric IP
      addresses is strongly discouraged.--></t>

      <t>The terms request-host and request-URI refer to the values the client
      would send to the server as, respectively, the host (but not port) and
      abs_path portions of the absoluteURI (http_URL) of the HTTP request line.
      Note that request-host must be a FQHN.  Hosts names can be specified
      either as an IP address or a FQHN string.  Sometimes we compare one host
      name with another.  Host A's name domain-matches host B's if
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>both host names are IP addresses and their host name strings match
        exactly; or</t>

        <t>both host names are FQDN strings and their host name strings match
        exactly; or</t>

        <t>A is a FQDN string and has the form NB, where N is a non-empty name
        string, B has the form .B, and B is a FQDN string.  (So, x.y.com
        domain-matches .y.com but not y.com.)</t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>Note that domain-match is not a commutative operation: a.b.c.com
      domain-matches .c.com, but not the reverse.</t>

      <t>Because it was used in Netscape's original implementation of state
      management, we will use the term cookie to refer to the state information
      that passes between an origin server and user agent, and that gets stored
      by the user agent.</t>
