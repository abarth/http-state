    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie headers.
      These headers can be used by HTTP servers to store state on HTTP user
      agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the
      mostly stateless HTTP protocol.  The cookie protocol has many
      historical infelicities and should be avoided for new applications of
      HTTP.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header.  Using
      the Set-Cookie header, an HTTP server can store name/value pairs
      (called cookies) at the user agent.  When the user agent makes
      subsequent requests to the server, the user agent will return the
      name/value pairs in the Cookie header.</t>

      <t>Although simple on its surface, the cookie protocol has a number of
      complexities.  For example, the server indicates a scope for each
      cookie when sending them to the user agent.  The scope indicates the
      maximum amount of time the user agent should persist the cookie, to
      which servers the user agent should return the cookie, and for which
      protocols the cookie is applicable.</t>

      <t>For historical reasons, the cookie protocol contains a number of
      security and privacy infelicities.  For example, a server can indicate
      that a given cookie is intended for "secure" connections, but the
      Secure attribute provides only confidentiality (not integrity) from
      active network attackers.  Similarly, cookies for a given host are
      shared across all the ports on that host, even though the usual
      "same-origin policy" used by web browsers isolates content retrieved
      from different ports.</t>

      <section anchor="syntax-notation" title="Syntax Notation">
        <t>This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
        notation of <xref target="RFC5234"/>.</t>

        <t>The following core rules are included by reference, as defined in
        <xref target="RFC5234"/>, Appendix B.1: ALPHA (letters), CR (carriage
        return), CRLF (CR LF), CTL (controls), DIGIT (decimal 0-9), DQUOTE
        (double quote), HEXDIG (hexadecimal 0-9/A-F/a-f), LF (line feed),
        OCTET (any 8-bit sequence of data), SP (space), HTAB (horizontal tab),
        VCHAR (any visible [USASCII] character), and WSP (whitespace).</t>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The terms user agent, client, server, proxy, and origin server have
      the same meaning as in the HTTP/1.0 specification.</t>

      <t>The terms request-host and request-URI refer to the values the user
      agent would send to the server as, respectively, the host (but not port)
      and abs_path portions of the absoluteURI (http_URL) of the HTTP request
      line.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Overview">
      <t>We outline here a way for an origin server to send state
      information to the user agent, and for the user agent to return the
      state information to the origin server.</t>

      <t>The origin server initiates a session, if it so desires, by
      including a Set-Cookie header in an HTTP response.  (Note that
      "session" here does not refer to a persistent network connection but
      to a logical session created from HTTP requests and responses.  The
      presence or absence of a persistent connection should have no effect
      on the use of cookie-derived sessions).</t>

      <t>The user agent returns a Cookie request header to the origin server
      if it chooses to continue a session. The Cookie header contains a number
      of cookies the user agent received in previous Set-Cookie headers. The
      origin server MAY ignore the Cookie header or use the header to
      determine the current state of the session. The origin server MAY send
      the user agent a Set-Cookie response header with the same or different
      information, or it MAY send no Set-Cookie header at all.</t>

      <t>Servers MAY return a Set-Cookie response headers with any
      response.  User agents should send Cookie request headers, subject to
      other rules detailed below, with every request.</t>

      <t>An origin server MAY include multiple Set-Cookie header fields in a
      single response. Note that an intervening gateway MUST NOT fold multiple
      Set-Cookie header fields into a single header field.</t>

    <section title="A Well-Behaved Profile of the Cookie Protocol">
      <t>This section describes the syntax and semantics of a well-behaved
      profile of the protocol.  Servers SHOULD use the profile described in
      this section, both to maximize interoperability with existing user
      agents and because a future version of the cookie protocol could remove
      support for some of the most esoteric aspects of the protocol.  User
      agents, however, MUST implement the full protocol to ensure
      interoperability with servers making use of the full protocol.</t>
 
      <section title="Set-Cookie">
        <t>The Set-Cookie header is used to send cookies from the server to
        the user agent.</t>

        <section title="Syntax">
          <t>Informally, the Set-Cookie response header comprises the token
          Set-Cookie:, followed by a cookie.  Each cookie begins with a
          name-value-pair, followed by zero or more semi-colon-separated
          attribute-value pairs.  Servers SHOULD NOT send Set-Cookie headers
          that fail to conform to the following grammar:</t>

            </artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>Servers SHOULD NOT include two attributes with the same name.</t>

          <t>The cookie-value is opaque to the user agent and MAY be
          anything the origin server chooses to send, possibly in a
          server-selected printable ASCII encoding.  "Opaque" implies that
          the content is of interest and relevance only to the origin
          server.  The content is, in fact, be readable by anyone who
          examines the Set-Cookie header.</t>

          <t>NOTE: The syntax above allows whitespace between the attribute
          and the U+3D ("=") character.  Servers wishing to interoperate
          with some legacy user agents might wish to elide this
          whitespace.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Semantics (Non-Normative)">
          <t>This section describes a simplified semantics of the Set-Cookie
          header. These semantics are detailed enough to be useful for
          understanding the most common uses of the cookie protocol. The full
          semantics are described in <xref target="cookie-protocol"
          />.</t>

          <t>When the user agent receives a Set-Cookie header, the user agent
          stores the cookie in its cookie store.When the user agent
          subsequently makes an HTTP request, the user agent consults its
          cookie store and includes the applicable, non-expired cookies in the
          Cookie header.</t>

          <t>If the cookie store already contains a cookie with the same
          cookie-name, domain-value, and path-value, the existing cookie is
          evicted from the cookie store and replaced with the new value.
          Notice that servers can delete cookies by setting their values to
          the empty string or by including an Expires attribute with a value
          in the past.</t>

          <t>By default, cookies are returned only to the origin server and
          expire at a the end of the current session (as defined by the user
          agent). The server can override the default handling of cookies by
          specifying various cookie attributes. User agents ignore
          unrecognized cookie attributes.</t>

          <section title="Expires">
            <t>The Expires attribute represent the maximum lifetime of the
            cookie, represented as the date and time at which the cookie
            expires. The user agent is not required to persist the cookie
            until the specified date has passed. In fact, user agents often
            evict cookies from the cookie store due to memory pressure or
            privacy concerns.</t>
          </section>
          <section title="Domain">
            <t>The Domain attribute specifies the hosts for which the cookie
            is applicable. For example, if the domain attribute contains the
            value ".example.com", the use agent will include the cookie in the
            Cookie header when making HTTPS requests to example.com,
            www.example.com, and www.corp.example.com. (Note that the leading
            U+2E (".") is meaningless and not required.) If the server omits
            the Domain attribute, the user agent will return the cookie only
            to the origin server</t>

            <t>The user agent will reject cookies less the Domain attribute
            specifies a scope for the cookie that would include the origin
            server. For example, the user agent will accept a Domain attribute
            of ".example.com" or of ".foo.example.com" from a response from
            foo.example.com, but the user agent will not accept a Domain
            attribute of ".bar.example.com" or ".baz.foo.example.com".</t>

            <t>NOTE: For security reasons, some user agents are configured to
            reject Domain attributes that do not correspond to a "registry
            controlled" domain (or a subdomain of a registry controlled
            domain). For example, some user agents will reject Domain
            attributes of ".com".</t>
          </section>
          <section title="Path">
            <t>The Path attribute limits the scope of the cookie to a set of
            paths. When a cookie has a Path attribute, the user agent will
            include the cookie in an HTTP request only if the path portion of
            the Request-URI matches (or is a subdirectory of) the cookie's
            Path attribute, where the U+2F ("/") character is interpreted as a
            directory separator. If the server omits the Path attribute, the
            user agent will use the directory of the Request-URI's path
            component as the default value.</t>

            <t>Although seemingly useful for isolating cookies between
            different paths within a given domain, the Path attribute cannot
            be relied upon for security for two reasons: First, user agents do
            not prevent one path from overwriting the cookies for another
            path. For example, a response to a request for /foo/bar.html can
            include a Set-Cookie header with a Path attribute of "/baz".
            Second, the "same-origin" policy implemented by many user agents
            does not isolate different paths within an origin. For example,
            /foo/bar.html can read cookies with a Path attribute of "/baz"
            because they are within the "same origin".</t>
          </section>
          <section title="Secure">
            <t>The Secure attribute limits the scope of the cookie to "secure"
            channels (where "secure" is defined by the user agent). When a
            cookie has the Secure attribute, the user agent will include the
            cookie in an HTTP request only if the request is transmitted over
            a secure channel (typically TLS <xref target="RFC5234"/>).</t>

            <t>Although seemingly useful for protecting cookies from active
            network attackers, the Secure attribute protects only the cookie's
            confidentiality. An active network attacker can overwrite Secure
            cookies from an insecure channel, disrupting the integrity of the
            cookies.</t>
          </section>
          <section title="HttpOnly">
            <t>The HttpOnly attribute limits the scope of the cookie to HTTP
            requests. In particular, the attribute instructs the user agent to
            elide the cookie when providing access to its cookie store via
            "non-HTTP" APIs (as defined by the user agent).</t>
          </section>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section title="Cookie">
        <section title="Syntax">
          <t>The user agent returns stored cookies to the origin server in
          the Cookie header.  If the server conforms to the requirements in
          this section, the requirements in the next section will cause the
          user agent to return a Cookie header that conforms to the following
          grammar.</t>

          <t>Notice that the cookie attributes are not returned. In
          particular, the server cannot determine from the Cookie header alone
          when a cookie will expire, for which domains the cookie is valid,

          <t>All sensitive information conveyed in these headers is exposed to

        <t>Servers SHOULD encrypt and sign their cookies. However, encrypting
        and signing cookies does not prevent an attacker from transplanting a
        cookie from one user agent to another.</t>

        <t>In addition to encrypting and signing the the contents of every
        cookie, servers that require a higher level of security SHOULD use the
        cookie protocol only over a secure channel.</t>

      <section title="Weak Confidentiality">
        <t>Cookies do provide isolation by port. If a cookie is readable by a
        service running on one port, the cookie is also readable by a service
        running on another port of the same server. If a cookie is writable by
        a service on one port, the cookie is also writable by a service
        running on another port of the same server. For this reason, servers
        SHOULD NOT both run mutually distrusting services on different ports
        of the same machine and use cookies to store security-sensitive
        information.</t>

        <t>Cookies do not provide isolation by scheme. Although most commonly
        used with the http and https schemes, the cookies for a given host are
        also available to other schemes, such as ftp and gopher. This lack of
        isolation is most easily seen when a user agent retrieves a URI with a
        gopher scheme via HTTP, but the lack of isolation by scheme is also
        apparent via non-HTTP APIs that permit access to cookies, such as
        HTML's document.cookie API.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Weak Integrity">
        <t>Cookies do not integrity guarantees for sibling domains (and their
        subdomains). For example, consider foo.example.com and
        bar.example.com. The foo.example.com server can set a cookie with a
        Domain attribute of ".example.com", and the user agent will include
        that cookie in HTTP requests to bar.example.com. In the worst case,
        bar.example.com will be unable to distinguish this cookie from a
        cookie it set itself. The foo.example.com server might be able to
        leverage this ability to mount an attack against bar.example.com.</t>

        <t>Similarly, an active network attacker can inject cookies into the
        Cookie header sent to https://example.com/ by impersonating a response
        from http://example.com/ and injecting a Set-Cookie header. The HTTPS
        server at example.com will be unable to distinguish these cookies from
        cookies that it set itself in an HTTPS response. An active network
        attacker might be able to leverage this ability to mount an attack
        against example.com even if example.com uses HTTPS exclusively.</t>

        <t>Servers can partially mitigate these attacks by encrypting and
        signing their cookies. However, using cryptography does not fully
        ameliorate the issue because an attacker can replay a cookie he or she
        received from the authentic example.com server in the user's session,
        with unpredictable results.</t>
