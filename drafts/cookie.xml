      <t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie headers.
      These headers can be used by HTTP servers to store state on HTTP user
      agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the
      mostly stateless HTTP protocol.  The cookie protocol has many
      historical infelicities and should be avoided for new applications of
      HTTP.

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header. Using
      the Set-Cookie header, an HTTP server can store name/value pairs and
      associated metadata (called cookies) at the user agent. When the user
      agent makes subsequent requests to the server, the user agent uses the
      metadata to determine whether to return the name/value pairs in the
      Cookie header.</t>

      <t>Although simple on its surface, the cookie protocol has a number of
      complexities.  For example, the server indicates a scope for each
      cookie when sending them to the user agent.  The scope indicates the
      maximum amount of time the user agent should retain the cookie, to
      which servers the user agent should return the cookie, and for which
      protocols the cookie is applicable.</t>

      <t>For historical reasons, the cookie protocol contains a number of
      security and privacy infelicities.  For example, a server can indicate
      that a given cookie is intended for "secure" connections, but the
      Secure attribute provides only confidentiality (not integrity) from
      active network attackers.  Similarly, cookies for a given host are
      shared across all the ports on that host, even though the usual
      "same-origin policy" used by web browsers isolates content retrieved
      from different ports.</t>

        the same meaning as in the HTTP/1.1 specification (<xref

        <t>The terms request-host and request-URI refer to the values the user
        agent would send to the server as, respectively, the host (but not

    <section anchor="overview" title="Overview">
      <t>We outline here a way for an origin server to send state
      information to a user agent, and for the user agent to return the
      state information to the origin server.</t>

      <t>To initiate a session, the origin server includes a Set-Cookie header
      in an HTTP response. (Note that "session" here does not refer to a
      persistent network connection but to a logical session created from HTTP
      requests and responses. The presence or absence of a persistent
      connection should have no effect on the use of cookie-derived
      sessions).</t>

      <t>The user agent returns a Cookie request header to the origin server
      if it chooses to continue a session. The Cookie header contains a number
      of cookies the user agent received in previous Set-Cookie headers. The
      origin server MAY ignore the Cookie header or use the header to
      determine the current state of the session. The origin server MAY send
      the user agent a Set-Cookie response header with the same or different
      information, or it MAY send no Set-Cookie header at all.</t>

      <t>Servers MAY return a Set-Cookie response header with any response.
      User agents SHOULD send a Cookie request header, subject to other rules
      detailed below, with every request.</t>

      <t>An origin server MAY include multiple Set-Cookie header fields in a
      single response. Note that an intervening gateway MUST NOT fold multiple
      Set-Cookie header fields into a single header field.</t>

    <section anchor="sane-profile" title="A Well-Behaved Profile">
      <t>This section describes the syntax and semantics of a well-behaved
      profile of the protocol.  Servers SHOULD use the profile described in
      this section, both to maximize interoperability with existing user
      agents and because a future version of the cookie protocol could remove
      support for some of the most esoteric aspects of the protocol.  User
      agents, however, MUST implement the full protocol to ensure
      interoperability with servers making use of the full protocol.</t>
 
      <section anchor="sane-set-cookie" title="Set-Cookie">
        <t>The Set-Cookie header is used to send cookies from the server to
        the user agent.</t>

        <section anchor="sane-set-cookie-syntax" title="Syntax">
          <t>Informally, the Set-Cookie response header comprises the token
          Set-Cookie:, followed by a cookie. Each cookie begins with a
          name-value-pair, followed by zero or more attribute-value pairs.
          Servers SHOULD NOT send Set-Cookie headers that fail to conform to
          the following grammar:</t>

          <t>Servers SHOULD NOT include two attributes with the same name.</t>

          <t>The cookie-value is opaque to the user agent and MAY be
          anything the origin server chooses to send. "Opaque" implies that
          the content is of interest and relevance only to the origin server.
          The content is, in fact, readable by anyone who examines the
          Set-Cookie header.</t>

          <t>To maximize compatibility with user agents, servers that wish to
          store non-ASCII data in a cookie-value SHOULD encode that data using
          a printable ASCII encoding, such as base64.</t>

          <t>NOTE: The syntax above allows whitespace between the attribute
          and the U+003D ("=") character.  Servers wishing to interoperate
          with some legacy user agents might wish to elide this
          whitespace.</t>

        <section anchor="sane-set-cookie-semantics"
                 title="Semantics (Non-Normative)">
          <t>This section describes a simplified semantics of the Set-Cookie
          header. These semantics are detailed enough to be useful for
          understanding the most common uses of the cookie protocol. The full
          semantics are described in <xref target="cookie-protocol"
          />.</t>

          <t>When the user agent receives a Set-Cookie header, the user agent
          stores the cookie in its cookie store.  When the user agent
          subsequently makes an HTTP request, the user agent consults its
          cookie store and includes the applicable, non-expired cookies in the
          Cookie header.</t>

          <t>If the cookie store already contains a cookie with the same
          cookie-name, domain-value, and path-value, the existing cookie is
          evicted from the cookie store and replaced with the new value.
          Notice that servers can delete cookies by including an Expires
          attribute with a value in the past.</t>

          <t>Unless the cookie's attributes indicate otherwise, the cookie is
          returned only to the origin server, and it expires at the end of the
          current session (as defined by the user agent). User agents ignore
          unrecognized cookie attributes.</t>

          <section anchor="sane-expires" title="Expires">
            <t>The Expires attribute indicates the maximum lifetime of the
            cookie, represented as the date and time at which the cookie
            expires. The user agent is not required to retain the cookie
            until the specified date has passed. In fact, user agents often
            evict cookies from the cookie store due to memory pressure or
            privacy concerns.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sane-domain" title="Domain">
            <t>The Domain attribute specifies those hosts for which the cookie
            will be sent. For example, if the Domain attribute contains the
            value ".example.com", the user agent will include the cookie in
            the Cookie header when making HTTP requests to example.com,
            www.example.com, and www.corp.example.com. (Note that a leading
            U+002E ("."), if present, is ignored.) If the server omits the
            Domain attribute, the user agent will return the cookie only to
            the origin server.
            <list>
              <t>WARNING: Some legacy user agents treat an absent Domain
              attribute as if the Domain attribute were present and contained
              the current host name. For example, if example.com returns a
              Set-Cookie header without a Domain attribute, these user agents
              will send the cookie to www.example.com.</t>
            </list>
            </t>

            <t>The user agent will reject cookies (refuse to store them in the
            cookie store) unless the Domain attribute specifies a scope for
            the cookie that would include the origin server. For example, the
            user agent will accept a Domain attribute of ".example.com" or of
            ".foo.example.com" from foo.example.com, but the user agent will
            not accept a Domain attribute of ".bar.example.com" or of
            ".baz.foo.example.com".</t>

            <t>NOTE: For security reasons, some user agents are configured to
            reject Domain attributes that do not correspond to a "registry
            controlled" domain (or a subdomain of a registry controlled
            domain). For example, some user agents will reject Domain
            attributes of ".com".</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sane-path" title="Path">
            <t>The Path attribute limits the scope of the cookie to a set of
            paths. When a cookie has a Path attribute, the user agent will
            include the cookie in an HTTP request only if the path portion of
            the Request-URI matches (or is a subdirectory of) the cookie's
            Path attribute, where the U+002F ("/") character is interpreted as a
            directory separator. If the server omits the Path attribute, the
            user agent will use the directory of the Request-URI's path
            component as the default value.</t>

            <t>Although seemingly useful for isolating cookies between
            different paths within a given domain, the Path attribute cannot
            be relied upon for security for two reasons: First, user agents do
            not prevent one path from overwriting the cookies for another
            path. For example, if a response to a request for /foo/bar.html
            attempts to set a cookie with a Path attribute of "/baz" the user
            agent will store that cookie in the cookie store. Second, the
            "same-origin" policy implemented by many user agents does not
            isolate different paths within an origin. For example,
            /foo/bar.html can read cookies with a Path attribute of "/baz"
            because they are within the "same origin".</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sane-secure" title="Secure">
            <t>The Secure attribute limits the scope of the cookie to "secure"
            channels (where "secure" is defined by the user agent). When a
            cookie has the Secure attribute, the user agent will include the
            cookie in an HTTP request only if the request is transmitted over
            a secure channel (typically TLS <xref target="RFC5246"/>).</t>

            <t>Although seemingly useful for protecting cookies from active
            network attackers, the Secure attribute protects only the cookie's
            confidentiality. An active network attacker can overwrite Secure
            cookies from an insecure channel, disrupting the integrity of the
            cookies.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sane-httponly" title="HttpOnly">
            <t>The HttpOnly attribute limits the scope of the cookie to HTTP
            requests. In particular, the attribute instructs the user agent to
            elide the cookie when providing access to its cookie store via
            "non-HTTP" APIs (as defined by the user agent).</t>

      <section anchor="sane-cookie" title="Cookie">
        <section anchor="sane-cookie-syntax" title="Syntax">
          <t>The user agent returns stored cookies to the origin server in
          the Cookie header.  If the server conforms to the requirements in
          this section, the requirements in the next section will cause the
          user agent to return a Cookie header that conforms to the following
          grammar:</t>

          <t>Each cookie-pair represents a cookie stored by the user

          from the corresponding parts of the Set-Cookie header.</t>

          <t>Notice that the cookie attributes are not returned. In
          particular, the server cannot determine from the Cookie header alone
          when a cookie will expire, for which domains the cookie is valid,
          for which paths the cookie is valid, or whether the cookie was set
          with the Secure or HttpOnly attributes.</t>

          <t>The semantics of individual cookies in the Cookie header is not
          defined by this document. Servers are expected to imbue these
          cookies with server-specific semantics.</t>

          <t>Although cookies are serialized linearly in the Cookie header,
          servers SHOULD NOT rely upon the serialization order. In particular,
          if the Cookie header contains two cookies with the same name,

      <section anchor="cookie" title="The Cookie Header">
        <t>When the user agent generates an HTTP request, the user agent
        SHOULD attach exactly one HTTP header named Cookie if the
        cookie-string (defined below) for the Request-URI is non-empty.</t>

        <t>A user agent MAY elide the Cookie header in its entirety if the
        user agent is configured to block sending cookies. For example, the
        user agent might wish to block sending cookies during "third-party"
        requests.</t>

        <t>The user agent MUST use the following algorithm to compute the
        cookie-string from a cookie store and a Request-URI:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Let cookie-list be the set of cookies from the cookie store
          that meet all of the following requirements:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Let request-host be the Request-URI's host. Either:
            <list style="empty">
              <t>The cookie's host-only-flag is true and the canonicalized

              <t>NOTE: The notion of a "secure" protocol is not defined by
              this document.  Typically, user agents consider a protocol

      <section anchor="implementation-limits" title="Limits">
        <t>Practical user agent implementations have limits on the number
        and size of cookies that they can store.  General-use user agents
        SHOULD provide each of the following minimum capabilities:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>At least 4096 bytes per cookie (as measured by the sum of the
          length of the cookie's name, value, and attributes).</t>

          <t>At least 50 cookies per domain.</t>

          <t>At least 3000 cookies total.</t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <t>Servers SHOULD use as few and as small cookies as possible to avoid
        reaching these implementation limits and to avoid network latency due
        to the Cookie header being included in every request.</t>

        <t>Servers should gracefully degrade if the user agent fails to return
        one or more cookies in the Cookie header because the user agent might
        evict any cookie at any time on orders from the user.</t>

      <section anchor="implementation-apis"
               title="Application Programmer Interfaces">
        <t>One reason the cookie protocol uses such an esoteric syntax is
        because many platforms (both in servers and user agents) provide
        string-based application programmer interfaces (APIs), requiring
        application-layer programmers to generate and parse the syntax used by
        the cookie protocol.</t>

        <t>Instead of providing string-based APIs to the cookie protocols,
        implementations would be well-served by providing more semantic APIs.
        It is beyond the scope of this document to recommend specific API
        designs, but there are clear benefits to accepting a abstract "Date"
        object instead of a serialized date string.</t>

               title="General Recommendations">
        <t>The cookie protocol is NOT RECOMMENDED for new applications.</t>

        <t>For applications that do use the cookie protocol, servers SHOULD
        NOT rely upon cookies for security.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="ambient-authority" title="Ambient Authority">
        <t>A server that uses cookies to authenticate users can suffer
        security vulnerabilities because some user agents let remote parties
        issue HTTP requests from the user agent (e.g., via HTTP redirects and
        HTML forms). When issuing those requests, user agent attaches cookies
        even if the entity does not know the contents of the cookies, possibly
        letting the remote entity exercise authority at an unwary server.</t>

        <t>Although this security concern goes by a number of names (e.g.,
        cross-site request forgery, confused deputy), the issue stems from
        cookies being a form of ambient authority. Cookies encourage server
        operators to separate designation (in the form of URLs) from
        authorization (in the form of cookies). Consequently, the user agent
        might supply the authorization for a resource designated by the
        attacker, possibly causing the server or its clients to undertake
        actions designated by the attacker as though they were authorized by
        the user.</t>

        <t>Instead of using cookies for authorization, server operators might
        wish to consider entangling designation and authorization by treating
        URLs as capabilities. Instead of storing secrets in cookies, this
        approach stores secrets in URLs, requiring the remote entity to supply
        the secret itself. Although this approach is not a panacea, judicious
        use of these principles can lead to more robust security.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="clear-text" title="Clear Text">
        <t>Unless sent over a secure channel (such as TLS), the information in
        the Set-Cookie and Cookie headers is transmitted in the clear.
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>All sensitive information conveyed in these headers is exposed to
          an eavesdropper.</t>

          <t>A malicious intermediary could alter the headers as they travel
          in either direction, with unpredictable results.</t>

          <t>A malicious client could alter the Cookie header before
          transmission, with unpredictable results.</t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <t>Servers SHOULD encrypt and sign the contents of cookies when
        transmitting them to the user agent (even when sending the cookies
        over a secure channel). However, encrypting and signing cookie
        contents does not prevent an attacker from transplanting a cookie from
        one user agent to another or from replaying the cookie at a later
        time.</t>

        <t>In addition to encrypting and signing the contents of every
        cookie, servers that require a higher level of security SHOULD use the
        cookie protocol only over a secure channel. When using the cookie
        protocol over a secure channel, servers SHOULD set the Secure
        attribute in every cookie. If a server does not set the Secure
        attribute, the protection provided by the secure channel will be
        largely moot.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="session-identifiers" title="Session Identifiers">
        <t>Instead of storing session information directly in a cookie (where
        it might be exposed to or replayed by an attacker), servers commonly
        store a nonce (or "session identifier") in a cookie. When the server
        receives an HTTP request with a nonce, the server can look up state
        information associated with the cookie using the nonce as a key.</t>

        <t>Using session identifier cookies limits the damage an attacker can
        cause if the attacker learns the contents of a cookie because the
        nonce is useful only for interacting with the server (unlike non-nonce
        cookie content, which might itself be sensitive). Furthermore, using a
        single nonce prevents an attacker from "splicing" together cookie
        content from two interactions with the server, which could cause the
        server to behave unexpectedly.</t>

        <t>Using session identifiers is not without risk. For example, the
        server SHOULD take care to avoid "session fixation" vulnerabilities. A
        session fixation attack proceeds in three steps. First, the
        attacker transplants a session identifier from his or her user agent
        to the victim's user agent. Second, the victim uses that session
        identifier to interact with the server, possibly imbuing the session
        identifier with the user's credentials or confidential information.
        Third, the attacker uses the session identifier to interact with
        server directly, possibly obtaining the user's authority or
        confidential information.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="weak-confidentiality" title="Weak Confidentiality">
        <t>Cookies do not provide isolation by port. If a cookie is readable
        by a service running on one port, the cookie is also readable by a
        service running on another port of the same server. If a cookie is
        writable by a service on one port, the cookie is also writable by a
        service running on another port of the same server. For this reason,
        servers SHOULD NOT both run mutually distrusting services on different
        ports of the same host and use cookies to store security-sensitive
        information.</t>

        <t>Cookies do not provide isolation by scheme. Although most commonly
        used with the http and https schemes, the cookies for a given host
        might also available to other schemes, such as ftp and gopher.
        Although this lack of isolation by scheme is most apparent in via
        non-HTTP APIs that permit access to cookies (e.g., HTML's
        document.cookie API), the lack of isolation by scheme is actually
        present in the cookie protocol itself (e.g., consider retrieving a URI
        with the gopher scheme via HTTP).</t>

        <t>Cookies do not always provide isolation by path. Although the
        network-level protocol does not send cookie stored for one path to
        another, some user agents expose cookies via non-HTTP APIs, such as
        HTML's document.cookie API. Because some of these user agents (e.g.,
        web browsers) do not isolate resources received from different paths,
        a resource retrieved from one path might be able to access cookies
        stored for another path.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="weak-integrity" title="Weak Integrity">
        <t>Cookies do not provide integrity guarantees for sibling domains
        (and their subdomains). For example, consider foo.example.com and
        bar.example.com. The foo.example.com server can set a cookie with a
        Domain attribute of ".example.com" (possibly overwriting an existing
        ".example.com" cookie set by bar.example.com), and the user agent will
        include that cookie in HTTP requests to bar.example.com. In the worst
        case, bar.example.com will be unable to distinguish this cookie from a
        cookie it set itself. The foo.example.com server might be able to
        leverage this ability to mount an attack against bar.example.com.</t>

        <t>Even though the cookie protocol supports the Path attribute, the
        Path attribute does not provide any integrity protection because the
        user agent with accept an arbitrary Path attribute in a Set-Cookie
        header. For example, an HTTP response to a request for
        http://example.com/foo/bar can set a cookie with a Path attribute of
        "/qux". Consequently, servers SHOULD NOT both run mutually distrusting
        services on different paths of the same host and use cookies store
        security sensitive information.</t>

        <t>An active network attacker can also inject cookies into the
        Cookie header sent to https://example.com/ by impersonating a response
        from http://example.com/ and injecting a Set-Cookie header. The HTTPS
        server at example.com will be unable to distinguish these cookies from
        cookies that it set itself in an HTTPS response. An active network
        attacker might be able to leverage this ability to mount an attack
        against example.com even if example.com uses HTTPS exclusively.</t>

        <t>Servers can partially mitigate these attacks by encrypting and
        signing the contents of their cookies. However, using cryptography
        does not mitigate the issue completely because an attacker can replay
        a cookie he or she received from the authentic example.com server in
        the user's session, with unpredictable results.</t>

        <t>Finally, an attacker might be able to force the user agent to
        delete cookies by storing large number of cookies. Once the user agent
        reaches its storage limit, the user agent will be forced to evict some
        cookies. Servers SHOULD NOT rely upon user agents retaining
        cookies.</t>
