      <t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields.
      These header fields can be used by HTTP servers to store state (called
      cookies) at HTTP user agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful
      session over the mostly stateless HTTP protocol. Although cookies have
      many historical infelicities that degrade their security and privacy, the
      Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields are widely used on the Internet.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields.
      Using the Set-Cookie header field, an HTTP server can pass name/value
      pairs and associated metadata (called cookies) to a user agent.  When the
      user agent makes subsequent requests to the server, the user agent uses
      the metadata and other information to determine whether to return the
      name/value pairs in the Cookie header.</t>

      <t>Although simple on their surface, cookies have a number of
      complexities. For example, the server indicates a scope for each cookie
      when sending it to the user agent. The scope indicates the maximum
      amount of time the user agent should return the cookie, the servers to
      which the user agent should return the cookie, and the URI schemes for
      which the cookie is applicable.</t>

      <t>For historical reasons, cookies contain a number of security and
      privacy infelicities. For example, a server can indicate that a given
      cookie is intended for "secure" connections, but the Secure attribute
      does not provide integrity in the presence of an active network
      attacker. Similarly, cookies for a given host are shared across all the
      ports on that host, even though the usual "same-origin policy" used by
      web browsers isolates content retrieved via different ports.</t>

      <t>Prior to this document, there were at least three descriptions of
      cookies: the so-called "Netscape cookie specification" <xref
      target="Netscape"/>, RFC 2109 <xref target="RFC2109"/>, and RFC 2965
      <xref target="RFC2965"/>. However, none of these documents describe how
      the Cookie and Set-Cookie headers are actually used on the Internet (see
      <xref target="Kri2001"/> for historical context). This document attempts
      to specify the syntax and semantics of these headers as they are
      actually used on the Internet.</t>

      <t>In particular, this document does not create new syntax or semantics
      beyond those in use today, but neither does it recommend all of the
      syntactic and semantic variations in use today.  The recommendations in
      this document represent a preferred subset of current behaviors.  Where
      some existing software differs from the recommended protocol in
      significant ways, the document contains a note explaining the
      difference.</t>

      <t>Therefore, in relation to previous IETF specifications of HTTP state
      management mechanisms, this document requests the following actions:
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>Change the status of <xref target="RFC2109" /> to Historic (it has
        already been obsoleted by <xref target="RFC2965"/>).</t>

        <t>Change the status of <xref target="RFC2965" /> to Historic.</t>

        <t>Indicate that <xref target="RFC2965" /> is obsoleted by this
        document.</t>
      </list>
      In particular, in moving RFC 2965 to Historic and obsoleting it, this
      document deprecates the use of the Cookie2 and Set-Cookie2 header
      fields.</t>

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref

        <t>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such
        as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort
        these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word
        ("MUST", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.</t>

        <t>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps can
        be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent.
        In particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are

      <section anchor="syntax-notation" title="Syntax Notation">
        <t>This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
        notation of <xref target="RFC5234"/>.</t>

        <t>The following core rules are included by reference, as defined in
        <xref target="RFC5234"/>, Appendix B.1: ALPHA (letters), CR (carriage
        return), CRLF (CR LF), CTL (controls), DIGIT (decimal 0-9), DQUOTE
        (double quote), HEXDIG (hexadecimal 0-9/A-F/a-f), LF (line feed), OCTET
        (any 8-bit sequence of data), SP (space), HTAB (horizontal tab), CHAR
        (any US-ASCII character), VCHAR (any visible US-ASCII character), and
        WSP (whitespace).</t>

        <t>The OWS (optional whitespace) rule is used where zero or more
        linear whitespace characters MAY appear:

        OWS SHOULD either not be produced or be produced as a single SP
        character.</t>

      <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
        <t>The terms user agent, client, server, proxy, and origin server have
        the same meaning as in the HTTP/1.1 specification (<xref
        target="RFC2616" />, Section 1.3).</t>

        <t>The request-host is the name of the host, as known by the user
        agent, to which the user agent is sending an HTTP request or is
        receiving an HTTP response from (i.e., the name of the host to which it
        sent the corresponding HTTP request).</t>

        <t>The term request-uri is defined in Section 5.1.2 of <xref
        target="RFC2616" />.</t>

        <t>Two sequences of octets are said to case-insensitively match each
        other if and only if they are equivalent under the i;ascii-casemap
        collation defined in <xref target="RFC4790"/>.</t>

        <t>The term string means a sequence of octets.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="overview" title="Overview">
      <t>This section outlines a way for an origin server to send state
      information to a user agent and for the user agent to return the state
      information to the origin server.</t>

      <t>To store state, the origin server includes a Set-Cookie header in an
      HTTP response. In subsequent requests, the user agent returns a Cookie
      request header to the origin server. The Cookie header contains
      cookies the user agent received in previous Set-Cookie headers. The
      origin server is free to ignore the Cookie header or use its contents
      for an application-defined purpose.</t>

      <t>Origin servers can send a Set-Cookie response header with any
      response. An origin server can include multiple Set-Cookie header fields
      in a single response.</t>

      <t>Origin servers SHOULD NOT fold multiple Set-Cookie header fields into
      a single header field.  The usual mechanism for folding HTTP headers
      fields (i.e., as defined in <xref target="RFC2616" />) might change the
      semantics of the Set-Cookie header field because the %x2C (",") character
      is used by Set-Cookie in a way that conflicts with such folding.</t>

      <section title="Examples">
        <t>Using the Set-Cookie header, a server can send the user agent a
        short string in an HTTP response that the user agent will return in
        future HTTP requests that are within the scope of the cookie. For
        example, the server can send the user agent a "session identifier"
        named SID with the value 31d4d96e407aad42. The user agent then returns
        the session identifier in subsequent requests.</t>

        </figure>

        <t>The server can alter the default scope
        of the cookie using the Path and Domain attributes. For example, the
        server can instruct the user agent to return the cookie to every path
        and every subdomain of example.com.</t>

          </artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>As shown in the next example, the server can store multiple cookies
        at the user agent. For example, the server can store a session
        identifier as well as the user's preferred language by returning two
        Set-Cookie header fields.  Notice that the server uses the Secure and
        HttpOnly attributes to provide additional security protections for the
        more-sensitive session identifier (see <xref
        target="sane-set-cookie-semantics"/>.)</t>

        <figure>
          <preamble>

          <artwork type="example">

Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; lang=en-US
          </artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Notice that the Cookie header above contains two cookies, one named
        SID and one named lang.  If the server wishes the user agent to persist
        the cookie over multiple "sessions" (e.g., user agent restarts), the
        server can specify an expiration date in the Expires attribute. Note
        that the user agent might delete the cookie before the expiration date
        if the user agent's cookie store exceeds its quota or if the user
        manually deletes the server's cookie.</t>

        <figure>
          <preamble>
== Server -> User Agent ==
          </preamble>
          <artwork type="example">

Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; lang=en-US
          </artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Finally, to remove a cookie, the server returns a Set-Cookie header
        with an expiration date in the past. The server will be successful in
        removing the cookie only if the Path and the Domain attribute in the
        Set-Cookie header match the values used when the cookie was
        created.</t>

    <section anchor="sane-profile" title="Server Requirements">
      <t>This section describes the syntax and semantics of a well-behaved
      profile of the Cookie and Set-Cookie headers. Servers SHOULD limit
      themselves to the profile described in this section, both to maximize
      interoperability with existing user agents and because a future version
      of the Cookie or Set-Cookie headers could remove support for some of the
      esoteric semantics described in <xref target="ua-requirements" />. User
      agents, however, MUST implement the requirements in <xref
      target="ua-requirements" /> to ensure interoperability with servers
      making use of the full semantics.</t>

        <section anchor="sane-set-cookie-syntax" title="Syntax">
          <t>Informally, the Set-Cookie response header contains the header

          <t>Note that some of the grammatical terms above reference documents
          that use different grammatical notations than this document (which
          uses ABNF from <xref target="RFC5234" />).</t>

          <t>The semantics of the cookie-value are not defined by this
          document.</t>

          <t>To maximize compatibility with user agents, servers that wish to
          store arbitrary data in a cookie-value SHOULD encode that data, for
          example, using Base 16 <xref target="RFC4648" />.</t>

          <t>The portions of the set-cookie-string produced by the cookie-av
          term are known as attributes.  To maximize compatibility with user
          agents, servers SHOULD NOT produce two attributes with the same name
          in the same set-cookie-string.</t>

          <t>Servers SHOULD NOT include more than one Set-Cookie header field
          in the same response with the same cookie-name.</t>

          <t>If a server sends multiple responses containing Set-Cookie headers
          concurrently to the user agent (e.g., when communicating with the
          user agent over multiple sockets), these responses create a "race
          condition" that can lead to unpredictable behavior.</t>

          <t>NOTE: Some existing user agents differ on their interpretation of
          two-digit years. To avoid compatibility issues, servers SHOULD use
          the rfc1123-date format, which requires a four-digit year.</t>

          <t>NOTE: Some user agents represent dates using 32-bit UNIX time_t
          values.  Some of these user agents might contain bugs that cause them
          to process dates after the year 2038 incorrectly.</t>

                 title="Semantics (Non-Normative)">
          <t>This section describes a simplified semantics of the Set-Cookie
          header. These semantics are detailed enough to be useful for
          understanding the most common uses of cookies by servers. The full
          semantics are described in <xref target="ua-requirements" />.</t>

          <t>When the user agent receives a Set-Cookie header, the user agent
          stores the cookie together with its attributes. Subsequently, when
          the user agent makes an HTTP request, the user agent includes the
          applicable, non-expired cookies in the Cookie header.</t>

          <t>If the user agent receives a new cookie with the same cookie-name,
          domain-value, and path-value as a cookie that it has already stored,
          the existing cookie is evicted and replaced with the new cookie.
          Notice that servers can delete cookies by sending the user agent a
          new cookie with an Expires attribute with a value in the past.</t>

          <t>Unless the cookie's attributes indicate otherwise, the cookie is
          returned only to the origin server (and not, e.g., to any
          subdomains), and it expires at the end of the current session (as
          defined by the user agent). User agents ignore unrecognized cookie
          attributes (but not the entire cookie).</t>

          <section anchor="sane-expires" title="The Expires Attribute">
            <t>The Expires attribute indicates the maximum lifetime of the
            cookie, represented as the date and time at which the cookie
            expires. The user agent is not required to retain the cookie
            until the specified date has passed. In fact, user agents often
            evict cookies due to memory pressure or privacy concerns.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sane-max-age" title="The Max-Age Attribute">
            <t>The Max-Age attribute indicates the maximum lifetime of the
            cookie, represented as the number of seconds until the cookie
            expires. The user agent is not required to retain the cookie for
            the specified duration. In fact, user agents often evict
            cookies from due to memory pressure or privacy concerns.
            <list>

              ignore the attribute.</t>
            </list>
            </t>

            <t>If a cookie has both the Max-Age and the Expires attribute, the
            Max-Age attribute has precedence and controls the expiration date
            of the cookie.  If a cookie has neither the Max-Age nor the Expires
            attribute, the user agent will retain the cookie until "the current
            session is over" (as defined by the user agent).</t>

          <section anchor="sane-domain" title="The Domain Attribute">
            <t>The Domain attribute specifies those hosts to which the cookie
            will be sent. For example, if the value of the Domain attribute
            is "example.com", the user agent will include the cookie in
            the Cookie header when making HTTP requests to example.com,
            www.example.com, and www.corp.example.com. (Note that a leading
            %x2E ("."), if present, is ignored even though that character is
            not permitted.) If the server omits the Domain attribute, the user
            agent will return the cookie only to the origin server.
            <list>
              <t>WARNING: Some existing user agents treat an absent Domain
              attribute as if the Domain attribute were present and contained
              the current host name. For example, if example.com returns a

            </t>

            <t>The user agent will reject cookies unless the Domain attribute
            specifies a scope for the cookie that would include the origin
            server. For example, the user agent will accept a cookie with a
            Domain attribute of "example.com" or of "foo.example.com" from
            foo.example.com, but the user agent will not accept a cookie with
            a Domain attribute of "bar.example.com" or of
            "baz.foo.example.com".</t>

            <t>NOTE: For security reasons, many user agents are configured to
            reject Domain attributes that correspond to "public suffixes".  For
            example, some user agents will reject Domain attributes of "com" or
            "co.uk".  (See <xref target="storage-model" /> for more
            information.)</t>

          <section anchor="sane-path" title="The Path Attribute">
            <t>The scope of each cookie is limited to a set of paths,
            controlled by the Path attribute.  If the server omits the Path
            attribute, the user agent will use the "directory" of the
            request-uri's path component as the default value. (See <xref
            target="cookie-path" /> for more details.)</t>

            <t>The user agent will include the cookie in an HTTP request only
            if the path portion of the request-uri matches (or is a
            subdirectory of) the cookie's Path attribute, where the %x2F
            ("/") character is interpreted as a directory separator.</t>

            <t>Although seemingly useful for isolating cookies between
            different paths within a given host, the Path attribute cannot
            be relied upon for security (see <xref

          <section anchor="sane-secure" title="The Secure Attribute">
            <t>The Secure attribute limits the scope of the cookie to "secure"
            channels (where "secure" is defined by the user agent). When a
            cookie has the Secure attribute, the user agent will include the
            cookie in an HTTP request only if the request is transmitted over a
            secure channel (typically HTTP over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
            HTTP over Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC2818" />,
            and TLS <xref target="RFC5246" /> itself).</t>

            <t>Although seemingly useful for protecting cookies from active
            network attackers, the Secure attribute protects only the cookie's
            confidentiality. An active network attacker can overwrite Secure
            cookies from an insecure channel, disrupting their integrity (see

            omit the cookie when providing access to cookies via "non-HTTP"
            APIs (such as a web browser API that exposes cookies to
            scripts).</t>

            <t>Note that the HttpOnly attribute is independent of the Secure

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>At least 4096 bytes per cookie (as measured by the sum of the
          length of the cookie's name, value, and attributes).</t>

        <t>Servers SHOULD use as few and as small cookies as possible to avoid

        due to the Cookie header being included in every request.</t>

        <t>Servers SHOULD gracefully degrade if the user agent fails to return

        <t>One reason the Cookie and Set-Cookie headers uses such esoteric
        syntax is because many platforms (both in servers and user agents)
        provide a string-based application programing interface (API) to
        cookies, requiring application-layer programmers to generate and parse
        the syntax used by the Cookie and Set-Cookie headers, which many
        programmers have done incorrectly, resulting in interoperability
        problems.</t>

        <t>Instead of providing string-based APIs to cookies, platforms would
        be well-served by providing more semantic APIs. It is beyond the scope
        of this document to recommend specific API designs, but there are
        clear benefits to accepting an abstract "Date" object instead of a

          example, some of these user agents refuse to send the Cookie
          header in third-party requests. Others refuse to process the
          Set-Cookie header in responses to third-party requests. User
          agents vary widely in their third-party cookie policies. This
          document grants user agents wide latitude to experiment with
          third-party cookie policies that balance the privacy and
          compatibility needs of their users. However, this document does
          not endorse any particular third-party cookie policy.</t>

          <t>Third-party cookie blocking policies are often ineffective at
          achieving their privacy goals if servers attempt to work around
          their restrictions to track users. In particular, two collaborating
          servers can often track users without using cookies at all.</t>

        <section anchor="user-controls" title="User Controls">
          <t>User agents should provide users with a mechanism for managing
          the cookies stored in the cookie store. For example, a user agent
          might let users delete all cookies received during a specified time
          period or all the cookies related to a particular domain. In
          addition, many user agents include a user interface element that lets
          users examine the cookies stored in their cookie store.</t>

          <t>User agents should provide users with a mechanism for disabling
          cookies. When cookies are disabled, the user agent MUST NOT include
          a Cookie header in outbound HTTP requests and the user agent MUST
          NOT process Set-Cookie headers in inbound HTTP responses.</t>

          <t>Some user agents provide users the option of preventing
          persistent storage of cookies across sessions. When configured
          thusly, user agents MUST treat all received cookies as if the
          persistent-flag were set to false.</t>

          <t>Some user agents provide users with the ability to approve
          individual writes to the cookie store. In many common usage
          scenarios, these controls generate a large number of prompts.
          However, some privacy-conscious users find these controls useful
          nonetheless.</t>

             title="Security Considerations">
      <section anchor="section-overview" title="Overview">
        <t>Cookies have a number of security pitfalls.  This section overviews
        a few of the more salient issues.</t>

        <t>In particular, cookies encourage developers to rely on ambient
        authority for authentication, often becoming vulnerable to attacks
        such as cross-site request forgery <xref target="CSRF" />. Also, when
        storing session identifiers in cookies, developers often create session
        fixation vulnerabilities.</t>

        <t>Transport-layer encryption, such as that employed in HTTPS, is
        insufficient to prevent a network attacker from obtaining or altering
        a victim's cookies because the cookie protocol itself has various
        vulnerabilities (see "Weak Confidentiality" and "Weak Integrity",
        below). In addition, by default, cookies do not provide
        confidentiality or integrity from network attackers, even when used in
        conjunction with HTTPS.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="ambient-authority" title="Ambient Authority">
        <t>A server that uses cookies to authenticate users can suffer
        security vulnerabilities because some user agents let remote parties
        issue HTTP requests from the user agent (e.g., via HTTP redirects or
        HTML forms). When issuing those requests, user agents attach cookies
        even if the remote party does not know the contents of the cookies,
        potentially letting the remote party exercise authority at an unwary
        server.</t>

        <t>Although this security concern goes by a number of names (e.g.,
        cross-site request forgery, confused deputy), the issue stems from
        cookies being a form of ambient authority. Cookies encourage server
        operators to separate designation (in the form of URLs) from
        authorization (in the form of cookies). Consequently, the user agent
        might supply the authorization for a resource designated by the
        attacker, possibly causing the server or its clients to undertake
        actions designated by the attacker as though they were authorized by
        the user.</t>

        <t>Instead of using cookies for authorization, server operators might
        wish to consider entangling designation and authorization by treating
        URLs as capabilities. Instead of storing secrets in cookies, this
        approach stores secrets in URLs, requiring the remote entity to supply
        the secret itself. Although this approach is not a panacea, judicious
        application of these principles can lead to more robust security.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="clear-text" title="Clear Text">
        <t>Unless sent over a secure channel (such as TLS), the information in
        the Cookie and Set-Cookie headers is transmitted in the clear.
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>All sensitive information conveyed in these headers is exposed to
          an eavesdropper.</t>

          <t>A malicious intermediary could alter the headers as they travel
          in either direction, with unpredictable results.</t>

          <t>A malicious client could alter the Cookie header before
          transmission, with unpredictable results.</t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <t>Servers SHOULD encrypt and sign the contents of cookies when
        transmitting them to the user agent (even when sending the cookies
        over a secure channel). However, encrypting and signing cookie
        contents does not prevent an attacker from transplanting a cookie from
        one user agent to another or from replaying the cookie at a later
        time.</t>

        <t>In addition to encrypting and signing the contents of every
        cookie, servers that require a higher level of security SHOULD use the
        Cookie and Set-Cookie headers only over a secure channel. When using
        cookies over a secure channel, servers SHOULD set the Secure
        attribute (see <xref target="sane-secure"/>) for every cookie. If a
        server does not set the Secure attribute, the protection provided by
        the secure channel will be largely moot.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="session-identifiers" title="Session Identifiers">
        <t>Instead of storing session information directly in a cookie (where
        it might be exposed to or replayed by an attacker), servers commonly
        store a nonce (or "session identifier") in a cookie. When the server
        receives an HTTP request with a nonce, the server can look up state
        information associated with the cookie using the nonce as a key.</t>

        <t>Using session identifier cookies limits the damage an attacker can
        cause if the attacker learns the contents of a cookie because the
        nonce is useful only for interacting with the server (unlike non-nonce
        cookie content, which might itself be sensitive). Furthermore, using a
        single nonce prevents an attacker from "splicing" together cookie
        content from two interactions with the server, which could cause the
        server to behave unexpectedly.</t>

        <t>Using session identifiers is not without risk. For example, the
        server SHOULD take care to avoid "session fixation" vulnerabilities. A
        session fixation attack proceeds in three steps. First, the
        attacker transplants a session identifier from his or her user agent
        to the victim's user agent. Second, the victim uses that session
        identifier to interact with the server, possibly imbuing the session
        identifier with the user's credentials or confidential information.
        Third, the attacker uses the session identifier to interact with
        server directly, possibly obtaining the user's authority or
        confidential information.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="weak-confidentiality" title="Weak Confidentiality">
        <t>Cookies do not provide isolation by port. If a cookie is readable
        by a service running on one port, the cookie is also readable by a
        service running on another port of the same server. If a cookie is
        writable by a service on one port, the cookie is also writable by a
        service running on another port of the same server. For this reason,
        servers SHOULD NOT both run mutually distrusting services on different
        ports of the same host and use cookies to store security-sensitive
        information.</t>

        <t>Cookies do not provide isolation by scheme. Although most commonly
        used with the http and https schemes, the cookies for a given host
        might also be available to other schemes, such as ftp and gopher.
        Although this lack of isolation by scheme is most apparent in
        non-HTTP APIs that permit access to cookies (e.g., HTML's
        document.cookie API), the lack of isolation by scheme is actually
        present in requirements for processing cookies themselves (e.g.,
        consider retrieving a URI with the gopher scheme via HTTP).</t>

        <t>Cookies do not always provide isolation by path. Although the
        network-level protocol does not send cookies stored for one path to
        another, some user agents expose cookies via non-HTTP APIs, such as
        HTML's document.cookie API. Because some of these user agents (e.g.,
        web browsers) do not isolate resources received from different paths,
        a resource retrieved from one path might be able to access cookies
        stored for another path.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="weak-integrity" title="Weak Integrity">
        <t>Cookies do not provide integrity guarantees for sibling domains
        (and their subdomains). For example, consider foo.example.com and
        bar.example.com. The foo.example.com server can set a cookie with a
        Domain attribute of "example.com" (possibly overwriting an existing
        "example.com" cookie set by bar.example.com), and the user agent will
        include that cookie in HTTP requests to bar.example.com. In the worst
        case, bar.example.com will be unable to distinguish this cookie from a
        cookie it set itself. The foo.example.com server might be able to
        leverage this ability to mount an attack against bar.example.com.</t>

        <t>Even though the Set-Cookie header supports the Path attribute, the
        Path attribute does not provide any integrity protection because the
        user agent will accept an arbitrary Path attribute in a Set-Cookie
        header. For example, an HTTP response to a request for
        http://example.com/foo/bar can set a cookie with a Path attribute of
        "/qux". Consequently, servers SHOULD NOT both run mutually distrusting
        services on different paths of the same host and use cookies to store
        security-sensitive information.</t>

        <t>An active network attacker can also inject cookies into the
        Cookie header sent to https://example.com/ by impersonating a response
        from http://example.com/ and injecting a Set-Cookie header. The HTTPS
        server at example.com will be unable to distinguish these cookies from
        cookies that it set itself in an HTTPS response. An active network
        attacker might be able to leverage this ability to mount an attack
        against example.com even if example.com uses HTTPS exclusively.</t>

        <t>Servers can partially mitigate these attacks by encrypting and
        signing the contents of their cookies. However, using cryptography
        does not mitigate the issue completely because an attacker can replay
        a cookie he or she received from the authentic example.com server in
        the user's session, with unpredictable results.</t>

        <t>Finally, an attacker might be able to force the user agent to
        delete cookies by storing a large number of cookies. Once the user agent
        reaches its storage limit, the user agent will be forced to evict some
        cookies. Servers SHOULD NOT rely upon user agents retaining
        cookies.</t>

      <section anchor="reliance-on-dns" title="Reliance on DNS">
        <t>Cookies rely upon the Domain Name System (DNS) for security. If the

              <t>Until now, there has been no standard method for domain names
              to use characters outside the ASCII repertoire.  This document
              defines internationalized domain names (IDNs) and a mechanism
              called Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) for
              handling them in a standard fashion.  IDNs use characters drawn
              from a large repertoire (Unicode), but IDNA allows the non-ASCII
              characters to be represented using only the ASCII characters
              already allowed in so-called host names today.  This
              backward-compatible representation is required in existing
              protocols like DNS, so that IDNs can be introduced with no
              changes to the existing infrastructure.  IDNA is only meant for
              processing domain names, not free text. [STANDARDS TRACK]</t>

          <t>Punycode is a simple and efficient transfer encoding syntax
          designed for use with Internationalized Domain Names in Applications
          (IDNA). It uniquely and reversibly transforms a Unicode string into
          an ASCII string. ASCII characters in the Unicode string are
          represented literally, and non-ASCII characters are represented by
          ASCII characters that are allowed in host name labels (letters,
          digits, and hyphens). This document defines a general algorithm
          called Bootstring that allows a string of basic code points to
          uniquely represent any string of code points drawn from a larger
          set. Punycode is an instance of Bootstring that uses particular
          parameter values specified by this document, appropriate for
          IDNA.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a large character set called the
            Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the
            world's writing systems. The originally proposed encodings of
            the UCS, however, were not compatible with many current
            applications and protocols, and this has led to the development
            of UTF-8, the object of this memo. UTF-8 has the characteristic
            of preserving the full US-ASCII range, providing compatibility
            with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on
            US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values. This memo
            obsoletes and replaces RFC 2279.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>Many Internet application protocols include string-based
            lookup, searching, or sorting operations. However, the problem
            space for searching and sorting international strings is large,
            not fully explored, and is outside the area of expertise for the
            Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Rather than attempt to
            solve such a large problem, this specification creates an
            abstraction framework so that application protocols can precisely
            identify a comparison function, and the repertoire of comparison
            functions can be extended in the future.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t>In the original version of the Internationalized Domain Names in
            Applications (IDNA) protocol, any Unicode code points taken from
            user input were mapped into a set of Unicode code points that "made
            sense", and then encoded and passed to the domain name system
            (DNS).  The IDNA2008 protocol (described in RFCs 5890, 5891, 5892,
            and 5893) presumes that the input to the protocol comes from a set
            of "permitted" code points, which it then encodes and passes to the
            DNS, but does not specify what to do with the result of user input.
            This document describes the actions that can be taken by an
            implementation between receiving user input and passing permitted
            code points to the new IDNA protocol.  This document is not an
            Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
            informational purposes.</t>
