      <t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie headers. These
      headers can be used by HTTP servers to store state (called cookies) at
      HTTP user agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over
      the mostly stateless HTTP protocol. Although cookies have many
      historical infelicities that degrade their security and privacy, the
      Cookie and Set-Cookie headers are widely used on the Internet.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie headers. Using
      the Set-Cookie header, an HTTP server can store name/value pairs and
      associated metadata (called cookies) at the user agent. When the user
      agent makes subsequent requests to the server, the user agent uses the
      metadata to determine whether to return the name/value pairs in the
      Cookie header.</t>

      <t>Although simple on its surface, cookies have a number of
      complexities. For example, the server indicates a scope for each cookie
      when sending them to the user agent. The scope indicates the maximum
      amount of time the user agent should return the cookie, the servers to
      which the user agent should return the cookie, and the protocols for
      which the cookie is applicable.</t>

      <t>For historical reasons, cookies contain a number of security and
      privacy infelicities. For example, a server can indicate that a given
      cookie is intended for "secure" connections, but the Secure attribute
      provides only confidentiality (not integrity) from active network
      attackers. Similarly, cookies for a given host are shared across all the
      ports on that host, even though the usual "same-origin policy" used by
      web browsers isolates content retrieved from different ports.</t>

      <t>Prior to this document, there were at least three descriptions of
      cookies: the so-called "Netscape cookie speciciation," RFC 2109 <xref
      target="RFC2109"/>, and RFC 2965 <xref target="RFC2965"/>.  However, none
      of these documents describe how the Cookie and Set-Cookie headers are
      actually used on the Internet.  By contrast, this document attempts to
      specify the syntax and semantics of these headers as they are actually
      used on the Internet.</t>

        <t>This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
        notation of <xref target="RFC5234"/>.</t>

        <t>The following core rules are included by reference, as defined in
        <xref target="RFC5234"/>, Appendix B.1: ALPHA (letters), CR (carriage
        return), CRLF (CR LF), CTL (controls), DIGIT (decimal 0-9), DQUOTE

        VCHAR (any visible [USASCII] character), and WSP (whitespace).</t>

        <t>The OWS (optional whitespace) rule is used where zero or more
        linear whitespace characters MAY appear. OWS SHOULD either not be
        produced or be produced as a single SP character. Multiple OWS
        characters that occur within field-content SHOULD be replaced with a
        single SP before interpreting the field value or forwarding the
        message downstream.</t>

      <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
        <t>The terms user agent, client, server, proxy, and origin server have
        the same meaning as in the HTTP/1.1 specification (<xref
        target="RFC2616"/>).</t>

        <t>The terms request-host and request-uri refer to the values the user
        agent would send to the server as, respectively, the host (but not
        port) and the absoluteURI (http_URL) of the HTTP Request-Line.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section anchor="overview" title="Overview">
      <t>We outline here a way for an origin server to send state
      information to a user agent and for the user agent to return the
      state information to the origin server.</t>

      <t>To store state, the origin server includes a Set-Cookie header in an
      HTTP response. In subsequent requests, the user agent returns a Cookie
      request header to the origin server. The Cookie header contains a number
      of cookies the user agent received in previous Set-Cookie headers. The
      origin server is free to ignore the Cookie header or use its contents
      for an application-defined purpose. The origin server MAY send the user
      agent a Set-Cookie response header with the same or different
      information, or it MAY send no Set-Cookie header at all.</t>

      <t>Servers MAY return a Set-Cookie response header with any response.  An
      origin server MAY include multiple Set-Cookie header fields in a single
      response.  Gateways that wish to be transparent to cookies MUST NOT fold
      multiple Set-Cookie header fields into a single header field.</t>

      <section title="Examples">
        <t>Using the Set-Cookie header, a server can send the user agent a
        short string in an HTTP response that the user agent will return in
        future HTTP requests. For example, the server can send the user agent
        a "session identifier" named SID with the value 31d4d96e407aad42. The
        user agent then returns the session identifier in subsequent
        requests.</t>

          </artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>The server can alter the default scope of the cookie using the Path
        and Domain attributes. For example, the server can instruct the user
        agent to return the cookie to every path and every subdomain of
        example.com.</t>

            ]]>
          </artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>The server can store multiple cookies at the user agent. For
        example, the server can store a session identifier as well as the
        user's preferred language by returning two Set-Cookie header fields.
        Notice that the server uses the Secure and HttpOnly attributes to
        provide additional security protections for the more-sensitive session
        identifier.</t>

            ]]>
          </artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>If the server wishes the user agent to persist the cookie over
        multiple sessions, the server can specify a expiration date in the
        Expires attribute. Note that the user agent might delete the
        cookie before the expiration date if the user agent's cookie store
        exceeds its quota or if the user manually deletes the server's
        cookie.</t>

            ]]>
          </artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Finally, to remove a cookie, the server returns a Set-Cookie header
        with an expiration date in the past. The server will be successful in
        removing the cookie only if the Path and the Domain attribute in the
        Set-Cookie header match the values used when the cookie was
        created.</t>

          <t>Servers SHOULD NOT include two attributes with the same name.</t>

          <t>Servers SHOULD NOT include two Set-Cookie header fields in the
          same response with the same cookie-name.</t>

          <t>The cookie-value is opaque to the user agent and MAY be
          anything the origin server chooses to send. "Opaque" implies that
          the content is of interest and relevance only to the origin server.
          The content is, in fact, readable by anyone who examines the
          Set-Cookie header.</t>

          <t>To maximize compatibility with user agents, servers that wish to
          store non-ASCII data in a cookie-value SHOULD encode that data using
          a printable ASCII encoding.</t>

          <t>If a server sends multiple responses containing Set-Cookie headers
          concurrently to the user agent (e.g., when communicating with the
          user agent over multiple sockets), these responses create a "race
          condition" that can lead to unpredictable behavior.</t>

          <t>NOTE: Some user agents represent dates using 32-bit UNIX time_t
          values.  Some of these user agents might contain bugs that cause them
          process dates after the year 2038 incorrectly. Servers wishing to
          interoperate with these user agents might wish to use dates before
          2038.</t>

        <section anchor="sane-set-cookie-semantics"
                 title="Semantics (Non-Normative)">
          <t>This section describes a simplified semantics of the Set-Cookie
          header. These semantics are detailed enough to be useful for
          understanding the most common uses of cookies. The full semantics
          are described in <xref target="ua-requirements" />.</t>

          <t>When the user agent receives a Set-Cookie header, the user agent
          stores the cookie in its cookie store. Subsequently, when the user
          agent makes an HTTP request, the user agent consults its cookie
          store and includes the applicable, non-expired cookies in the Cookie
          header.</t>

          <t>If the user agent receives a new cookie with the same
          cookie-name, domain-value, and path-value as a cookie that already
          exists in its cookie store, the existing cookie is evicted from the
          cookie store and replaced with the new cookie. Notice that servers
          can delete cookies by sending the user agent a new cookie with an
          Expires attribute with a value in the past.</t>

          <t>Unless the cookie's attributes indicate otherwise, the cookie is
          returned only to the origin server, and it expires at the end of the
          current session (as defined by the user agent). User agents ignore
          unrecognized cookie attributes.</t>

          <section anchor="sane-expires" title="The Expires Attribute">
            <t>The Expires attribute indicates the maximum lifetime of the
            cookie, represented as the date and time at which the cookie
            expires. The user agent is not required to retain the cookie
            until the specified date has passed. In fact, user agents often
            evict cookies from the cookie store due to memory pressure or
            privacy concerns.</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sane-max-age" title="The Max-Age Attribute">
            <t>The Max-Age attribute indicates the maximum lifetime of the
            cookie, represented as the number of seconds until the cookie
            expires. The user agent is not required to retain the cookie until
            the specified date has passed. In fact, user agents often evict
            cookies from the cookie store due to memory pressure or privacy
            concerns.
            <list>
              <t>WARNING: Not all user agents support the Max-Age attribute.
              User agents that do not support the Max-Age attribute will ignore
              the attribute.</t>
            </list>
            </t>

            <t>If a cookie has both the Max-Age and the Expires attribute, the
            Max-Age attribute has precedence and controls the expiration date
            of the cookie.  If a cookie has neither the Max-Age nor the Expires
            attribute, the user agent will retain the cookie until "the current
            session is over" (as defined by the user agent).</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sane-domain" title="The Domain Attribute">
            <t>The Domain attribute specifies those hosts to which the cookie
            will be sent. For example, if the Domain attribute contains the
            value "example.com", the user agent will include the cookie in
            the Cookie header when making HTTP requests to example.com,
            www.example.com, and www.corp.example.com. (Note that a leading
            U+002E ("."), if present, is ignored even though that character is
            not permitted by the subdomain production in <xref target="RFC1034"
            />.) If the server omits the Domain attribute, the user agent will
            return the cookie only to the origin server.
            <list>
              <t>WARNING: Some legacy user agents treat an absent Domain
              attribute as if the Domain attribute were present and contained
              the current host name. For example, if example.com returns a
              Set-Cookie header without a Domain attribute, these user agents
              will erroneously send the cookie to www.example.com as well.</t>
            </list>
            </t>

            <t>The user agent will reject cookies (refuse to store them in the
            cookie store) unless the Domain attribute specifies a scope for
            the cookie that would include the origin server. For example, the
            user agent will accept a Domain attribute of "example.com" or of
            "foo.example.com" from foo.example.com, but the user agent will
            not accept a Domain attribute of "bar.example.com" or of
            "baz.foo.example.com".</t>

            <t>NOTE: For security reasons, some user agents are configured to
            reject Domain attributes that correspond to "public suffixes." For
            example, some user agents will reject Domain attributes of "com"
            or "co.uk".</t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="sane-path" title="The Path Attribute">
            <t>The scope of each cookie is limited to a set of paths,
            controlled by the Path attribute.  If the server omits the Path
            attribute, the user agent will use the directory of the
            request-uri's path component as the default value.</t>

            subdirectory of) the cookie's Path attribute, where the U+002F
            ("/") character is interpreted as a directory separator.</t>

            <t>Although seemingly useful for isolating cookies between
            different paths within a given domain, the Path attribute cannot

            cookie has the Secure attribute, the user agent will include the
            cookie in an HTTP request only if the request is transmitted over
            a secure channel (typically TLS <xref target="RFC5246" />).</t>

            <t>Although seemingly useful for protecting cookies from active
            network attackers, the Secure attribute protects only the cookie's

          particular, the server cannot determine from the Cookie header alone
          when a cookie will expire, for which domains the cookie is valid,
          for which paths the cookie is valid, or whether the cookie was set
          with the Secure or HttpOnly attributes.</t>

          <t>The semantics of individual cookies in the Cookie header is not
          defined by this document. Servers are expected to imbue these
          cookies with application-specific semantics.</t>

          <t>Although cookies are serialized linearly in the Cookie header,
          servers SHOULD NOT rely upon the serialization order. In particular,
          if the Cookie header contains two cookies with the same name (e.g.,
          with different Path or Domain attributes), servers SHOULD NOT rely
          upon the order in which these cookies appear in the header.</t>

        <t>Practical user agent implementations have limits on the number

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>At least 4096 bytes per cookie (as measured by the sum of the
          length of the cookie's name, value, and attributes).</t>

          <t>At least 3000 cookies total.</t>

        <t>Servers SHOULD use as few and as small cookies as possible to avoid
        reaching these implementation limits and to avoid network latency due
        to the Cookie header being included in every request.</t>

        <t>Servers should gracefully degrade if the user agent fails to return
        one or more cookies in the Cookie header because the user agent might
        evict any cookie at any time on orders from the user.</t>

      <section anchor="implementation-apis"
               title="Application Programmer Interfaces">
        <t>One reason the Cookie and Set-Cookie headers uses such esoteric
        syntax is because many platforms (both in servers and user agents)
        provide a string-based application programmer interface (API) to
        cookies, requiring application-layer programmers to generate and parse
        the syntax used by the Cookie and Set-Cookie headers.</t>

        <t>Instead of providing string-based APIs to cookies, platforms would
        be well-served by providing more semantic APIs. It is beyond the scope
        of this document to recommend specific API designs, but there are

    <section anchor="privacy-considerations"
             title="Privacy Considerations">
        <t>Cookies are often criticized for letting servers track
        users. For example, a number of "web analytics" companies use cookies
        to recognize when a user returns to a web site or visits another web
        site. Although cookies are not the only mechanism servers can use to
        track users across HTTP requests, cookies facilitate tracking because
        they are persistent across user agent sessions and can be shared
        between domains.</t>

        <section anchor="third-party-cookies" title="Third-Party Cookies">
          <t>Particularly worrisome are so-called "third-party" cookies. In
          rendering an HTML document, a user agent often requests resources
          from other servers (such as advertising networks). These third-party
          servers can use cookies to track the user even if the
          user never visits the server directly.</t>

          <t>Some user agents restrict how third-party cookies behave. For
          example, some user agents refuse to send the Cookie header in
          third-party requests. Other user agents refuse to process the
          Set-Cookie header in responses to third-party requests. User agents
          vary widely in their third-party cookie policies. This document
          grants user agents wide latitude to experiment with third-party
          cookie policies that balance the privacy and compatibility needs of
          their users. However, this document does not endorse any particular
          third-party cookie policy.</t>

          <t>Third-party cookie blocking policies are often ineffective at
          achieving their privacy goals if servers attempt to work around
          their restrictions to track users. In particular, two collaborating
          servers can often track users without using cookies at all.</t>

        <section anchor="user-controls" title="User Controls">
          <t>User agents SHOULD provide users with a mechanism for managing
          the cookies stored in the cookie store. For example, a user agent
          might let users delete all cookies received during a specified time
          period or all the cookies related to a particular domain. In
          addition, many user agent include a user interface element that lets
          users examine the cookies stored in their cookie store.</t>

          <t>User agents SHOULD provide users with a mechanism for disabling
          cookies. When cookies are disabled, the user agent MUST NOT include
          a Cookie header in outbound HTTP requests and the user agent MUST
          NOT process Set-Cookie headers in inbound HTTP responses.</t>

          <t>Some user agents provide users the option of preventing
          persistent storage of cookies across sessions. When configured
          thusly, user agents MUST treat all received cookies as if the
          persistent-flag were set to false.</t>

          <t>Some user agents provide users with the ability to approve
          individual writes to the cookie store. In many common usage
          scenarios, these controls generate a large number of prompts.

             title="Security Considerations">
      <section anchor="section-overview" title="Overview">
        <t>Cookies have a number of security and privacy pitfalls.</t>

        <t>In particular, cookies encourage developers to rely on ambient
        authority for authentication, often becoming vulnerable to attacks
        such as cross-site request forgery. Also, when storing session
        identifiers in cookies, developers often create session fixation
        vulnerabilities.</t>

        <t>Transport-layer encryption, such as that employed in HTTPS, is
        insufficient to prevent a network attacker from obtaining or altering
        a victim's cookies because the cookie protocol itself has various
        vulnerabilities (see "Weak Confidentiality" and "Weak Integrity",
        below). In addition, by default, cookies do not provide
        confidentiality or integrity from network attackers, even when used in
        conjunction with HTTPS.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="ambient-authority" title="Ambient Authority">
        <t>A server that uses cookies to authenticate users can suffer
        security vulnerabilities because some user agents let remote parties
        issue HTTP requests from the user agent (e.g., via HTTP redirects or
        HTML forms). When issuing those requests, user agents attach cookies
        even if the remote party does not know the contents of the cookies,
        potentially letting the remote party exercise authority at an unwary
        server.</t>

        <t>Although this security concern goes by a number of names (e.g.,
        cross-site request forgery, confused deputy), the issue stems from
        cookies being a form of ambient authority. Cookies encourage server
        operators to separate designation (in the form of URLs) from
        authorization (in the form of cookies). Consequently, the user agent
        might supply the authorization for a resource designated by the
        attacker, possibly causing the server or its clients to undertake
        actions designated by the attacker as though they were authorized by
        the user.</t>

        <t>Instead of using cookies for authorization, server operators might
        wish to consider entangling designation and authorization by treating
        URLs as capabilities. Instead of storing secrets in cookies, this
        approach stores secrets in URLs, requiring the remote entity to supply
        the secret itself. Although this approach is not a panacea, judicious
        use of these principles can lead to more robust security.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="clear-text" title="Clear Text">
        <t>Unless sent over a secure channel (such as TLS), the information in
        the Cookie and Set-Cookie headers is transmitted in the clear.
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>All sensitive information conveyed in these headers is exposed to
          an eavesdropper.</t>

          <t>A malicious intermediary could alter the headers as they travel
          in either direction, with unpredictable results.</t>

          <t>A malicious client could alter the Cookie header before
          transmission, with unpredictable results.</t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <t>Servers SHOULD encrypt and sign the contents of cookies when
        transmitting them to the user agent (even when sending the cookies
        over a secure channel). However, encrypting and signing cookie
        contents does not prevent an attacker from transplanting a cookie from
        one user agent to another or from replaying the cookie at a later
        time.</t>

        <t>In addition to encrypting and signing the contents of every
        cookie, servers that require a higher level of security SHOULD use the
        Cookie and Set-Cookie headers only over a secure channel. When using
        cookies over a secure channel, servers SHOULD set the Secure attribute
        for every cookie. If a server does not set the Secure attribute, the
        protection provided by the secure channel will be largely moot.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="session-identifiers" title="Session Identifiers">
        <t>Instead of storing session information directly in a cookie (where
        it might be exposed to or replayed by an attacker), servers commonly
        store a nonce (or "session identifier") in a cookie. When the server
        receives an HTTP request with a nonce, the server can look up state
        information associated with the cookie using the nonce as a key.</t>

        <t>Using session identifier cookies limits the damage an attacker can
        cause if the attacker learns the contents of a cookie because the
        nonce is useful only for interacting with the server (unlike non-nonce
        cookie content, which might itself be sensitive). Furthermore, using a
        single nonce prevents an attacker from "splicing" together cookie
        content from two interactions with the server, which could cause the
        server to behave unexpectedly.</t>

        <t>Using session identifiers is not without risk. For example, the
        server SHOULD take care to avoid "session fixation" vulnerabilities. A
        session fixation attack proceeds in three steps. First, the
        attacker transplants a session identifier from his or her user agent
        to the victim's user agent. Second, the victim uses that session
        identifier to interact with the server, possibly imbuing the session
        identifier with the user's credentials or confidential information.
        Third, the attacker uses the session identifier to interact with
        server directly, possibly obtaining the user's authority or
        confidential information.</t>

      <section anchor="weak-confidentiality" title="Weak Confidentiality">
        <t>Cookies do not provide isolation by port. If a cookie is readable
        by a service running on one port, the cookie is also readable by a
        service running on another port of the same server. If a cookie is
        writable by a service on one port, the cookie is also writable by a
        service running on another port of the same server. For this reason,
        servers SHOULD NOT both run mutually distrusting services on different
        ports of the same host and use cookies to store security-sensitive
        information.</t>

        <t>Cookies do not provide isolation by scheme. Although most commonly
        used with the http and https schemes, the cookies for a given host
        might also be available to other schemes, such as ftp and gopher.
        Although this lack of isolation by scheme is most apparent in via
        non-HTTP APIs that permit access to cookies (e.g., HTML's
        document.cookie API), the lack of isolation by scheme is actually
        present in requirements for processing cookies themselves (e.g.,
        consider retrieving a URI with the gopher scheme via HTTP).</t>

        <t>Cookies do not always provide isolation by path. Although the
        network-level protocol does not send cookie stored for one path to
        another, some user agents expose cookies via non-HTTP APIs, such as
        HTML's document.cookie API. Because some of these user agents (e.g.,
        web browsers) do not isolate resources received from different paths,
        a resource retrieved from one path might be able to access cookies
        stored for another path.</t>

      <section anchor="weak-integrity" title="Weak Integrity">
        <t>Cookies do not provide integrity guarantees for sibling domains
        (and their subdomains). For example, consider foo.example.com and
        bar.example.com. The foo.example.com server can set a cookie with a
        Domain attribute of "example.com" (possibly overwriting an existing
        "example.com" cookie set by bar.example.com), and the user agent will
        include that cookie in HTTP requests to bar.example.com. In the worst
        case, bar.example.com will be unable to distinguish this cookie from a
        cookie it set itself. The foo.example.com server might be able to
        leverage this ability to mount an attack against bar.example.com.</t>

        <t>Even though the Set-Cookie header supports the Path attribute, the
        Path attribute does not provide any integrity protection because the
        user agent will accept an arbitrary Path attribute in a Set-Cookie
        header. For example, an HTTP response to a request for
        http://example.com/foo/bar can set a cookie with a Path attribute of
        "/qux". Consequently, servers SHOULD NOT both run mutually distrusting
        services on different paths of the same host and use cookies store
        security-sensitive information.</t>

        <t>An active network attacker can also inject cookies into the
        Cookie header sent to https://example.com/ by impersonating a response
        from http://example.com/ and injecting a Set-Cookie header. The HTTPS
        server at example.com will be unable to distinguish these cookies from
        cookies that it set itself in an HTTPS response. An active network
        attacker might be able to leverage this ability to mount an attack
        against example.com even if example.com uses HTTPS exclusively.</t>

        <t>Servers can partially mitigate these attacks by encrypting and
        signing the contents of their cookies. However, using cryptography
        does not mitigate the issue completely because an attacker can replay
        a cookie he or she received from the authentic example.com server in
        the user's session, with unpredictable results.</t>

        <t>Finally, an attacker might be able to force the user agent to
        delete cookies by storing large number of cookies. Once the user agent
        reaches its storage limit, the user agent will be forced to evict some
        cookies. Servers SHOULD NOT rely upon user agents retaining
        cookies.</t>

      <section anchor="reliance-on-dns" title="Reliance on DNS">
        <t>Cookies rely upon the Domain Name System (DNS) for security. If the
        DNS is partially or fully compromised, the cookie protocol might fail
        to provide the security properties required by applications.</t>

          <t>Punycode is a simple and efficient transfer encoding syntax
          designed for use with Internationalized Domain Names in Applications
          (IDNA). It uniquely and reversibly transforms a Unicode string into
          an ASCII string. ASCII characters in the Unicode string are
          represented literally, and non-ASCII characters are represented by
          ASCII characters that are allowed in host name labels (letters,
          digits, and hyphens). This document defines a general algorithm
          called Bootstring that allows a string of basic code points to
          uniquely represent any string of code points drawn from a larger
          set. Punycode is an instance of Bootstring that uses particular
          parameter values specified by this document, appropriate for
          IDNA.</t>

            <t>ISO/IEC 10646-1 defines a large character set called the
            Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the
            world's writing systems. The originally proposed encodings of
            the UCS, however, were not compatible with many current
            applications and protocols, and this has led to the development
            of UTF-8, the object of this memo. UTF-8 has the characteristic
            of preserving the full US-ASCII range, providing compatibility
            with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on
            US-ASCII values but are transparent to other values. This memo
