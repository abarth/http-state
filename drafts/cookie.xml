      <t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The terms user agent, client, server, proxy, and origin server have
      the same meaning as in the HTTP/1.0 specification.</t>

      <t>Fully-qualified host name (FQHN) means either the fully-qualified
      domain name (FQDN) of a host (i.e., a completely specified domain name
      ending in a top-level domain such as .com or .uk), or the numeric
      Internet Protocol (IP) address of a host.  The fully qualified domain
      name is preferred; use of numeric IP addresses is strongly
      discouraged.  [TODO: What does "strongly discouraged" mean?]</t>

      <t>The terms request-host and request-URI refer to the values the
      client would send to the server as, respectively, the host (but not
      port) and abs_path portions of the absoluteURI (http_URL) of the HTTP
      request line.  Note that request-host must be a FQHN.  Hosts names can
      be specified either as an IP address or a FQHN string.</t>

      <t>Because it was used in Netscape's original implementation of state
      management, we will use the term cookie to refer to the state
      information that passes between an origin server and user agent, and
      that gets stored by the user agent.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Overview">
      <t>We outline here a way for an origin server to send state
      information to the user agent, and for the user agent to return the
      state information to the origin server.</t>

      <t>The origin server initiates a session, if it so desires, by
      including a Set-Cookie header in an HTTP response.  (Note that
      "session" here does not refer to a persistent network connection but
      to a logical session created from HTTP requests and responses.  The
      presence or absence of a persistent connection should have no effect
      on the use of cookie-derived
      sessions).</t>

      <t>A user agent returns a Cookie request header (see below) to the
      origin server if it chooses to continue a session.  The origin server
      may ignore it or use it to determine the current state of the
      session.  It may send the client a Set-Cookie response header
      with the same or different information, or it may send no Set-Cookie
      header at all.</t>

      <t>Servers may return a Set-Cookie response headers with any
      response.  User agents should send Cookie request headers, subject to
      other rules detailed below, with every request.</t>

      <t>An origin server may include multiple Set-Cookie headers in a
      response.  Note that an intervening gateway MUST NOT fold multiple
      Set-Cookie headers into a single header.</t>

      <t>[TODO: Overview the Set-Cookie and Cookie headers.]</t>

      <section title="Examples">
        <t>[TODO: Put some examples here.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Protocol Description">
      <t>The cookie protocol consists of two HTTP headers: the Set-Cookie
      header and the Cookie header.  The server sends the Set-Cookie header
      is to the user agent in an HTTP response, causing the user agent to
      modify the Cookie header it returns to the server.</t>

      <t>This section describes the syntax and semantics of the protocol.
      Detailed conformance requirements for user agents are given in Section
      [TODO].</t>
 
      <section title="Set-Cookie">
        <section title="Syntax">
          <t>Informally, the Set-Cookie response header comprises the token
          Set-Cookie:, followed by a cookie.  Each cookie begins with a
          name-value-pair, followed by zero or more semi-colon-separated
          attribute-value pairs.</t>

          <figure>
            <artwork>
              <![CDATA[
  set-cookie-header = "Set-Cookie:" name-value-pairs
  name-value-pairs  = name-value-pair *(";" name-value-pair)
  name-value-pair   = name ["=" value]        ; optional value
  name              = token
  value             = *CHAR
              ]]>
            </artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>The valid character for the value production vary depending on
          the attribute name.</t>

          <t>[TODO: Investigate what token actually means.]</t>

          <t>Attributes names are case-insensitive.  White space is
          permitted between tokens.  Servers MUST NOT include two attributes
          with the same name.  Note that although the above syntax
          description shows value as optional, some attributes require
          values.</t>

          <t>The cookie-value is opaque to the user agent and MAY be
          anything the origin server chooses to send, possibly in a
          server-selected printable ASCII encoding.  "Opaque" implies that
          the content is of interest and relevance only to the origin
          server.  The content may, in fact, be readable by anyone who
          examines the Set-Cookie header.</t>

          <t>NOTE: The syntax above allows whitespace between the attribute
          and the U+3D ("=") character.  Servers wishing to interoperate
          with some legacy user agents might wish to elide this extra white
          space to maximize compatibility.</t>
        </section>
        <section title="Semantics">
          <t>When the user agent receives a Set-Cookie header, the user
          agent stores the cookie in its cookie store.  When the user agent
          makes another HTTP request to the origin server, the user agent
          returns the cookie in the Cookie header.</t>

          <t>The server can override the default handling of cookies by
          specifying cookie attributes.  User agents ignore unrecognized
          cookie attributes.</t>

          <section title="Max-Age">
            <t>[TODO: Consider removing Max-Age from the server conformance
            section because it's not supported by IE.]

      <section title="Controlling Caching">
        <t>[TODO: Should we go into this much detail here?  This seems
        redundant with the HTTP specs.]</t>

        <t>An origin server must be cognizant of the effect of possible
        caching of both the returned resource and the Set-Cookie header.
        Caching "public" documents is desirable.  For example, if the origin
        server wants to use a public document such as a "front door" page as
        a sentinel to indicate the beginning of a session for which a
        Set-Cookie response header must be generated, the page should be
        stored in caches "pre-expired" so that the origin server will see
        further requests.  "Private documents", for example those that
        contain information strictly private to a session, should not be
        cached in shared caches.</t>

        <t>If the cookie is intended for use by a single user, the Set-Cookie
        header should not be cached.  A Set-Cookie header that is intended to
        be shared by multiple users may be cached.</t>

        <t>The origin server should send the following additional HTTP/1.1
        response headers, depending on circumstances:  [TODO: Is this good
        advice?]
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>To suppress caching of the Set-Cookie header: Cache-control: no-
          cache="set-cookie".</t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <t>and one of the following:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>To suppress caching of a private document in shared caches:
          Cache-Control: private.</t>

          <t>To allow caching of a document and require that it be validated
          before returning it to the client: Cache-Control:
          must-revalidate.</t>

          <t>To allow caching of a document, but to require that proxy caches
          (not user agent caches) validate it before returning it to the
          client: Cache-Control: proxy-revalidate.</t>

          <t>To allow caching of a document and request that it be validated
          before returning it to the client (by "pre-expiring" it):
          Cache-Control: max-age=0.  Not all caches will revalidate the
          document in every case.</t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <t>HTTP/1.1 servers must send Expires: old-date (where old-date is a
        date long in the past) on responses containing Set-Cookie response
        headers unless they know for certain (by out of band means) that
        there are no downstream HTTP/1.0 proxies.  HTTP/1.1 servers may send
        other Cache-Control directives that permit caching by HTTP/1.1
        proxies in addition to the Expires: old-date directive; the
        Cache-Control directive will override the Expires: old-date for
        HTTP/1.1 proxies.</t>

    <section title="User Agent Conformance">
      <t>Not all origin servers conform to the behavior specified in the
      previous section.  To ensure interoperability, user agents MUST

      the requirements in this section.</t>
