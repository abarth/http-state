Subject: Cookies, Expires, and TimeZones

Hey, Adam!

I don't know if you've encountered this yet in your research into cookie
differences, but the pre-RFC cookie spec demands that the Expires attribute
use GMT as the timezone for the Expires value. Internet Explorer thus also
requires GMT.

We've recently determined that some servers (e.g. Facebook, on occasion)
will send an Expires value which uses a different timezone (e.g. "PST")
rather than GMT. It appears that some non-IE browsers support this, but IE
does not and thus treats the received cookie as a session cookie.
