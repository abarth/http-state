I just did a quick test with an ISO-8859-1 encoded cookie value, 
client-side javascript and "alert(document.cookie)":

- IE and Firefox appear to treat the cookie as ISO-8859-1
- Safari appears to ignore the cookie
- Chrome and Opera appear to try to decode as UTF-8 (and returns a 
REPLACEMENT CHAR in place of the umlaut I tried)

Best regards, Julian
