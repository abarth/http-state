Subject: Re: [http-state] some notes on cookies

Thanks indeed!

I am also including below two interesting comments from the Firefox cookie
source code (nsCookieService.cpp):

------8<------8<------8<------8<------
   /*
    * |ispathdelimiter| tests four cases: '/', '?', '#', and ';'.
    * '/' is the "standard" case; the '?' test allows a site at host/abc?def
    * to receive a cookie that has a path attribute of abc.  this seems
    * strange but at least one major site (citibank, bug 156725) depends
    * on it.  The test for # and ; are put in to proactively avoid problems
    * with other sites - these are the only other chars allowed in the path.
    */


    // when path lengths match, older cookies should be listed first.  this is
    // required for backwards compatibility since some websites erroneously
    // depend on receiving cookies in the order in which they were sent to the
    // browser!  see bug 236772.
------8<------8<------8<------8<------

The bugs referenced are pretty old (and very entertaining to read, IMHO),
but they still define the browser' s behavior.  Whether any sites *today*
depend on this behavior is anybody's guess.
