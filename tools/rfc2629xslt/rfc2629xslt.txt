1.  Introduction

   This document describes a set of XSLT transformations that can be
   used to transform RFC2629-compliant XML (see [RFC2629]) to various
   output formats, such as HTML and PDF.  The main topics are

   o  compliance to the xml2rfc XML element set (Section 2),

   o  support for xml2rfc processing instructions (Section 3),

   o  the names of anchor elements generated in HTML and PDF output
      (Section 4),

   o  various XSLT engines that can be used (Section 5),

   o  outputting HTML (Section 6) and XHTML (Section 7),

   o  outputting CHM (Compiled Microsoft Help, Section 8),

   o  outputting PDF (Section 9),

   o  extensions to the xml2rfc vocabulary (Section 10).

   o  various utilities (Section 11).

   The full distribution is available at
   <http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2629xslt.zip>.

2.  Supported RFC2629 elements

   "rfc2629.xslt" supports both all RFC2629 grammar elements and the
   extensions implemented in xml2rfc 1.33.

2.1.  Extension elements

   "rfc2629.xslt" supports two kind of extension elements, using
   different XML namespaces.

   The first set contains (hopefully) generally useful extensions, see
   Section 10.

   The second set is used for change and issue tracking and currently is
   not documented here.  Please email the author in case you're
   interested in using these extensions.

3.  Processing Instructions

   All PIs can be set as XSLT parameter as well, overriding any value
   that is found in the source file to be transformed.

   Using processing instructions:

   <?rfc toc="yes"?>
   <?rfc-ext support-rfc2731="no"?>

   Using XSLT parameters (Saxon):

   java -cp saxon.jar com.icl.saxon.StyleSheet source.xml rfc2629.xslt \
     xml2rfc-toc=yes xml2rfc-ext-support-rfc2731=no > result.html

   Using XSLT parameters (xsltproc):

   xsltproc --param xml2rfc-toc '"yes"' \
      --param xml2rfc-ext-support-rfc2731 '"no"' \
      rfc2629.xslt source.xml > result.html

   (note the required quoting of string parameters)

4.  Anchors

   The transformation automatically generates anchors that are supposed
   to be stable and predictable and that can be used to identify
   specific parts of the document.  Anchors are generated both in HTML
   and XSL-FO content (but the latter will only be used for PDF output
   when the XSL-FO engine supports producing PDF anchors).

5.  Supported XSLT engines

   The transformation requires a non-standard extension function (see
   exsl:node-set [1]) which is however widely available.  XSLT
   processors that do not support this extension (or a functional
   equivalent) currently are not supported.

5.1.  Standalone Engines

   The following XSLT engines are believed to work well:

   o  Windows: MSXML3 and MSXML4 (<http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml>;
      command line processor "msxsl" is available from Microsoft
      Download Center [2])

   o  Java: Saxon (<http://saxon.sourceforge.net/>)

   o  Java: Xalan (<http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/>)

   o  C/C++: xsltproc (libxslt) (<http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/>, make sure
      that you have a current version)

5.2.  In-Browser Engines

   The following browsers seem to work fine:

   o  Internet Explorer 5.5 (Windows version, if MSXML3 is installed)

   o  Internet Explorer 6 and newer

   o  Firefox 3.0 and newer


      *  Be aware that XSLT execution can be suppressed using
         NoScript [3]

      *  Firefox does not load external DTDs nor external entities, see
         Mozilla Bug 22942 [4], thus entities like &nbsp; need to be
         declared in the internal subset (Appendix C.1)

   o  Safari 3 (starting with version 3.0.4)

   o  Google Chrome (beta available)

   o  Opera 10 (beta version available)

   The following browsers are known not to work properly:




Reschke                                                        [Page 15]

Documentation             RFC2629 through XSLT              January 2010


   o  Firefox 1.*/2.*: (missing extension function - see change request
      at Mozilla BugZilla 193678 [5])

   o  Opera 9.21: execution fails, potentially to a somewhat complex
      XPath expression (reported to Opera as bug 245725).

   o  Opera 9.5 and 9.6: transformation appears to work, but CSS isn't
      getting applied (reported to Opera as bug 337388 on 2008-06-12).

   o  Safari 2.* supports client-side XSLT as of MacOS X 10.4, but
      misses required extension functions.  A problem with stylesheets
      producing non-ASCII output (such as NBSP characters) has been
      fixed as of OSX 10.4.4.  Both problems have been reported through
      Apple's bug tracking system, see <http://drakken.dbc.mtview.ca.us/
      pipermail/xml2rfc/2005-May/002073.html> and
      <http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4079>.

6.  Transforming to HTML

   Transformation to HTML can be done inside the browser if it supports
   XSLT.  To enable this, add the following processing instruction to
   the start of the source file:

     <?xml-stylesheet type='text/xsl' href='rfc2629.xslt' ?>

   (and ensure that "rfc2629.xslt" is present).

6.1.  HTML compliance

   The transformation result is supposed to conform to the HTML 4.01
   strict DTD [HTML].  This can be checked using the W3C's online
   validator at <http://validator.w3.org>.

6.2.  Standard HTML LINK elements

   LINK elements exist since HTML 2.0.  They can be used to embed
   content-independant links inside the document.  Unfortunately, only
   few user agents support this element.  Firefox users may want to
   check the Link Widgets [6] extension.

                 The following LINK elements are produced:

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | LINK type | description                                           |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | alternate | for RFCs, a link to the authorative ASCII version on  |
   |           | the IETF web site                                     |
   |           |                                                       |
   | appendic  | pointer to all top-level appendics                    |
   |           |                                                       |
   | author    | pointer to "authors" section                          |
   |           |                                                       |
   | chapter   | pointer to all top-level sections                     |
   |           |                                                       |
   | contents  | pointer to table of contents                          |
   |           |                                                       |
   | copyright | pointer to copyright statement                        |
   |           |                                                       |
   | index     | pointer to index                                      |

   Navigation Bar for rfc2396.xml.

6.3.  Standard HTML metadata

          The following standard HTML META elements are produced:

      +-----------+-------------------------------------------------+
      | META name | description                                     |
      +-----------+-------------------------------------------------+
      | generator | from XSLT engine version and stylesheet version |
      |           |                                                 |
      | keywords  | from keyword elements in front section          |
      +-----------+-------------------------------------------------+

6.4.  Dublin Core (RFC2731) metadata

   Unless turned off using the "rfc-ext support-rfc2731" processing
   instruction, the transformation will generate metadata according to
   [RFC2731] and [DC-HTML].

                The following DCMI properties are produced:

   +-------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | META name               | description                             |
   +-------------------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | DC.Creator              | from author information in front        |
   |                         | section                                 |
   |                         |                                         |
   | DC.Date.Issued          | from date information in front section  |
   |                         |                                         |
   | DC.Description.Abstract | from abstract                           |
   |                         |                                         |
   | DC.Identifier           | document URN [RFC2648] from "docName"   |
   |                         | attribute                               |
   |                         |                                         |
   | DC.isPartOf             | RFC ISSN (for RFCs)                     |
   |                         |                                         |
   | DC.Relation.Replaces    | from "obsoletes" attribute              |

7.  Transforming to XHTML

   Transforming to XHTML requires slightly different XSLT output options
   and is implemented by the derived transformation script
   "rfc2629toXHTML.xslt".

      Note: Microsoft Internet Explorer does _not_ support XHTML.
      Therefore it usually makes more sense to generate plain old HTML.

8.  Transforming to CHM (Microsoft Compiled Help)

   To generate a CHM file using Microsoft's HTML Help Compiler (hhc),
   three files are required in addition to the HTML file.

   1.  hhc - table of contents file (HTML)

   2.  hhk - index file (HTML)

   3.  hhp - project file (plain text)

   The three files are generated with three specific transformations,
   each requiring the additional XSLT parameter "basename" to specify
   the filename prefix.

   Example:

   saxon rfc2616.xml rfc2629toHhp.xslt basename=rfc2616  > rfc2616.hhp
   saxon rfc2616.xml rfc2629toHhc.xslt basename=rfc2616  > rfc2616.hhc
   saxon rfc2616.xml rfc2629toHhk.xslt basename=rfc2616  > rfc2616.hhk
   hhc rfc2616.hhp

   Transformation to XSL-FO [XSL-FO] format is available through
   "rfc2629toFO.xslt" (which includes "rfc2629.xslt", so keep both in
   the same folder).

   Compared to HTML user agents, XSL-FO engines unfortunately either
   come as open source (for instance, Apache FOP) or feature-complete
   (for instance, AntennaHouse XSL Formatter), but not both at the same
   time.

   As Apache FOP needs special workarounds (page breaking, table
   layout), and some popular extensions aren't standardized yet, the
   translation produces a generic output (hopefully) conforming to
   [XSL-FO].  Specific backends ("xsl11toFop-0.95xslt",
   "xsl11toXep.xslt", "xsl11toAn.xslt") then provide post-processing for
   the individual processors.

      Note: the output is currently targeted at Apache FOP 0.95.

9.1.2.  Example: producing output for Apache FOP

   Example:

   saxon rfc2616.xml rfc2629toFo.xslt > tmp.fo
   saxon tmp.fo xsl11toFop-0.95.xslt > rfc2629.fo

9.2.  Via X(HTML)

   PDF output can also be produced directly from (X)HTML.  One simple
   approach is to rely on the browser's printing function, and to use a
   printer driver that produces PDF.  Depending on the brower's CSS
   capabilities, the output will behave properly with respect to table
   breaks etc.

   An alternative is PrinceXML (see <http://www.princexml.com/>), which
   can produce PDF directly from (X)HTML input, based on the CSS
   printing information.

   For instance, PDF output with text justification turned on can be
   produced with:

   saxon input.xml rfc2629toXHTML.xslt xml2rfc-ext-justification=print \
     > output.xhtml
   prince output.xhtml output.pdf

10.  Generic Extensions

   This section documents extensions implemented in "rfc2629.xslt",
   using the extension namespace "http://purl.org/net/xml2rfc/ext".

10.1.  <abnf-char-sequence> element

   Converts the contained quoted string into a hex-encoded character
   sequence, for use in case-sensitive ABNF productions.

   For instance, "<x:abnf-char-sequence>"HTTP"</x:abnf-char-sequence>"
   gets converted to "%x48.54.54.50".

10.2.  <anchor-alias> element

   Using its "value" attribute, this element allows the definition of an
   internal link target alias for the enclosing element.  This alias can
   then be used with the <ref> element for intra-document references.

   Note that the anchor alias is not subject to the naming constraints
   that apply to anchor elements (which are XML names).

10.3.  <bcp14> element

   This element marks the content as being one of the normative keywords
   defined in [RFC2119].

























Reschke                                                        [Page 23]

Documentation             RFC2629 through XSLT              January 2010


   The DOCTYPE definition below allows using these keywords using XML
   entity expansion: such as in "...server &MUST; accept...".

   <!DOCTYPE rfc [
    <!ENTITY MAY "<bcp14 xmlns='http://purl.org/net/xml2rfc/ext'
      >MAY</bcp14>">
    <!ENTITY MUST "<bcp14 xmlns='http://purl.org/net/xml2rfc/ext'
      >MUST</bcp14>">
    <!ENTITY MUST-NOT "<bcp14 xmlns='http://purl.org/net/xml2rfc/ext'
      >MUST NOT</bcp14>">
    <!ENTITY OPTIONAL "<bcp14 xmlns='http://purl.org/net/xml2rfc/ext'
      >OPTIONAL</bcp14>">
    <!ENTITY RECOMMENDED "<bcp14 xmlns='http://purl.org/net/xml2rfc/ext'
      >RECOMMENDED</bcp14>">
    <!ENTITY REQUIRED "<bcp14 xmlns='http://purl.org/net/xml2rfc/ext'
      >REQUIRED</bcp14>">
    <!ENTITY SHALL "<bcp14 xmlns='http://purl.org/net/xml2rfc/ext'
      >SHALL</bcp14>">
    <!ENTITY SHALL-NOT "<bcp14 xmlns='http://purl.org/net/xml2rfc/ext'
      >SHALL NOT</bcp14>">
    <!ENTITY SHOULD "<bcp14 xmlns='http://purl.org/net/xml2rfc/ext'
      >SHOULD</bcp14>">
    <!ENTITY SHOULD-NOT "<bcp14 xmlns='http://purl.org/net/xml2rfc/ext'
      >SHOULD NOT</bcp14>">]>

10.4.  <bb> element

   Marking up a string as <bb> indicates that it represents the bottom
   line of a box drawing, replacing the "+" and "-" characters
   accordingly.

10.5.  <bc> element

   Marking up a string as <bc> indicates that it represents a center
   line of a box drawing, replacing the "|" character accordingly.

10.6.  <blockquote> element

   This element is like the "blockquote" element in [HTML] (note this is
   a block-level element!).  It should contain one or more <t> child
   elements.

10.7.  <boilerplate> element

   Can be used to include boilerplate (status, copyright, ...) into the
   front or back section. <section> elements within <x:boilerplate>
   appear as unnumbered sections in the output.




Reschke                                                        [Page 24]

Documentation             RFC2629 through XSLT              January 2010


   _This element currently can not be "down-translated" for use in
   xml2rfc!_

10.8.  <bt> element

   Marking up a string as <bt> indicates that it represents the top line
   of a box drawing, replacing the "+" and "-" characters accordingly.

10.9.  <dfn> element

   This element is like the "dfn" element in [HTML].

10.10.  <h> element

   This element is like the "h" element in [XHTML2].

10.11.  <highlight> element

   Used to highlight text passages, currently only allowed in <artwork>.

   Note: this is stripped when generating input for xml2rfc, so please
   use with care.

10.12.  <length-of> element

   This element can be used to insert the length of another formatted
   section (in decimal).

   Example: computing the Content-Length header value

   <artwork>
   ...
   Content-Length: <x:length-of target="req"/>

   <x:span anchor="req">123456789
   <x:span><artwork/>

   The lenght computation counts line ends as two characters (CRLF).

   Note that indentation characters in artwork _will_ be counted.  The
   "indented" attribute allows to specify the amount of indentation to
   be substracted from the computed length.

10.13.  <link> element

   This element can be added as a top-level child element below <rfc> to
   indicate additional link information.  It's currently used only when
   generating HTML output, in which case an HTML <link> element with



Reschke                                                        [Page 25]

Documentation             RFC2629 through XSLT              January 2010


   identical attributes gets generated.

   Example: generating HTML link element

           <x:link xmlns="http://purl.org/net/xml2rfc/ext"
               rel="Bookmark"
               title="IETF WEBDAV Working Group"
               href="http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/"/>

10.14.  <lt> element

   Used for grouping multiple <t> elements into a single list item.

10.15.  <note> element

   Can be used to add a note, usually indented by a few characters.  It
   should contain one or more <t> child elements.

10.16.  <parse-xml> element

   This element instructs the processor to parse the contents as XML and
   to warn when there's a problem (requires either MSXML or Saxon8 or
   newer).

10.17.  <q> element

   This element is like the "q" element in [HTML].

10.18.  <ref> element

   This element is a simplified variant of the <xref> element, in that
   no "target" attribute needs to be specified, instead the text
   contents acts as identifier.  That in itself wouldn't be terribly
   useful, but together with the <anchor-alias>, it allows referring to
   other parts of the document with minimal additional markup.

   For instance, given an alias definition such as

         <section title="Test" anchor="test">
           <x:anchor-alias value="alias1"/>
           <x:anchor-alias value="alias 2"/>
           ...
         </section>

   the following simple references

         <x:ref>test</x:ref>
         <x:ref>alias1</x:ref>



Reschke                                                        [Page 26]

Documentation             RFC2629 through XSLT              January 2010


         <x:ref>alias 2</x:ref>

   are equivalent to...:

         <xref target="test">test</xref>
         <xref target="test">alias1</xref>
         <xref target="test">alias 2</xref>

10.19.  <source> element

   Can be used to enhance a <reference> with information about the
   location for the XML source.  This can be used by the <xref>
   processing code to automatically extract the target section number.

   For example:

         ...
         <xref target="RFC2616" x:fmt="of" x:rel="#PUT" />
         ...

         <reference target="RFC2616"/>
           ...
           <x:source href="rfc2616.xml"/>
           ...

10.20.  <sup> element

   This element is like the "sup" element in [HTML].

   Note: the down conversion to RFC2629 format replaces "x^y" by "x^y".

10.21.  Extensions to Xml2rfc <artwork> element

   Sometimes, artwork occurs inside lists.  To get it indent properly in
   xml2rfc's text output, it needs to be indented in the source.  This
   is sub-optimal, as this whitespace will also appear in the HTML
   output, where it's already indented due to HTML's semantics.

   As a workaround, a "x:indent-with" attribute can be specified,
   containing a string that will be prepended to each line when
   "clean-for-DTD.xslt" is run (see Section 11.4).

10.22.  Extensions to Xml2rfc <iref> element

   The extension attribute below is allowed on the standard <iref>
   element:





Reschke                                                        [Page 27]

Documentation             RFC2629 through XSLT              January 2010


   o  x:for-anchor specifies that the <iref> will also be automatically
      inserted whenever the specified anchor is cross-referenced -- this
      may save entering lots of <iref> instances.  As a special case, a
      value of "" (empty string) refers to the anchor attribute of the
      closest ancestor.

10.23.  Extensions to Xml2rfc <list> element

   The extension attribute below is allowed on the standard <list>
   element:

   o  x:indent specifies the amount of indentation for list items in
      hanging lists.  This can be useful when the output format, such as
      XSL-FO, does not support automatical formatting.  The value takes
      an XSL-FO width, such as "5em".  The default is _length of longest
      label in characters_ times _0.8em_.

   Also, the <list> element can take <x:lt> child elements instead of
   <t>, allowing to insert multiple paragraphs into a single list item.

10.24.  Extensions to Xml2rfc <rfc> element

   The extension attributes below are allowed on the standard <rfc>
   element:

   o  grddl:transformation can be used to reference a GRDDL transform.

   o  x:maturiy-level can be used to specify the IETF Standards Track
      Maturity Level of "proposed", "draft" or "internet" (see Section
      4.1 of [RFC2026]).

10.25.  Extensions to Xml2rfc <section> element

   The extension attribute below is allowed on the standard <list>
   element:

   o  x:fixed-section-number can be used to specify a fixed section
      number.  This can be useful when formatting historic documents
      that used a different numbering style.

10.26.  Extensions to Xml2rfc <xref> element

   Three extension attributes are allowed on the standard <xref>
   element:

   1.  x:sec can be specified to point to a specific section of the
       referenced document,




Reschke                                                        [Page 28]

Documentation             RFC2629 through XSLT              January 2010


   2.  x:rel may specify a relative reference to use when linking into
       the referenced document (if linking by section number is not
       available),

   3.  x:fmt defines the text format to be used.

   The following formats are defined for the x:fmt attribute:

   , (Comma)  [_reference_], Section _sec_

   () [_reference_] (Section _sec_)

   anchor  Like the default format, but without brackets.

   of Section _sec_ of [_reference_]

   number  _sec_

   none  No output (can be used to have xrefs to references without
      having them rendered as such)

   sec  Section _sec_

   These extensions are currently only supported for <xref> elements
   without child nodes.

   If the processor knows how to reference the target section, it will
   generate a link directly to the target section, such as in [RFC2119],
   Section 5.

11.  Utilities

11.1.  Checking References

   "check-references.xslt" can be used to check all references to RFC-
   and ID-series IETF publications and to W3C publications (note this
   script requires local copies of
   <ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc-index.xml> and
   <http://www.w3.org/2002/01/tr-automation/tr.rdf> and will use the XML
   status information provided at <http://tools.ietf.org/>).

   If the document is supposed to be published on the IETF standards
   track, the desired level can be specified using the parameter
   "intended-level" as 'proposed', 'draft' or 'internet'.
   Alternatively, it can be specified inside the document using the
   attribute x:maturity-level on the <rfc> element.

   Note: Downward references should be annotated using the <annotate>
   element, containing an <xref> to [BCP97].

   When an XSLT 2.0 processor is used, links in the document can be
   checked as well using the "link-check" paramerer ('yes' or 'no').
   Note that this only works for http links to documents of type text/*.

   Recognized formats in the <seriesInfo> element are:

   o  for RFCs, the name attribute must be "RFC", and the value
      attribute must be the number of the RFC,

   o  for Internet Drafs, the name attribute must be "ID" or "Internet-
      Draft", and the value attribute must be the file name of the draft
      (including the two-digit running number, but excluding a file
      extension),




Reschke                                                        [Page 31]

Documentation             RFC2629 through XSLT              January 2010


   o  for W3C documents, the name attribute must be "W3C", must start
      with "W3C ", or must start with "World Wide Web Consortium ", and
      the value attribute must be the "shorthand" name of the
      specification, such as "REC-xml-19980210".

      Note: this stylesheet will need network access to check links and
      status of Internet Drafts.  When running a Java-based XSLT engine,
      you may have to supply Java system properties specifying the HTTP
      proxy to be used, such as "-Dhttp.proxyHost=hostname
      -Dhttp.proxyPort=80".

11.2.  Generating Graphs from References

   "gen-reference-graph.xslt" generates a graph of RFC dependencies,
   using the same base data as in "check-references.xslt" (see
   Section 11.1).  Its output is a "dot" file, to be processed by
   GraphViz (see <http://www.graphviz.org/>).

   The picture below shows the RFC dependencies in RFC2629.


11.3.  Producing reference entries for books

   "amazon-asin.xslt" uses the Amazon web services to generate a
   <reference> element for a given ASIN (ISBN).

   For instance:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <references>
    <reference target="urn:isbn:0134516591">
      <front>
        <title>Simple Book, The: An Introduction to Internet Management,
                  Revised Second Edition</title>
        <author surname="Rose"
                   fullname="Marshall T. Rose" initials="M. T. ">
          <organization/>
        </author>
        <author surname="Marshall"
                   fullname="Rose T. Marshall" initials="R. T.">
          <organization/>
        </author>
        <date year="1996" month="March"/>
      </front>
      <seriesInfo name="Prentice Hall" value=""/>
    </reference>
   </references>

Documentation             RFC2629 through XSLT              January 2010


   Note that the resulting XML usually requires checking, in this case
   Amazon's database is playing tricks with Marshall's name...

11.4.  Down-converting to RFC2629bis DTD

   "clean-for-DTD.xslt" can be used to down-convert some extensions to a
   format that is supported by the base xml2rfc distribution.  Note that
   these extensions are experimental (feedback appreciated).

   The following mappings are done:

   o  <iref> elements inside <artwork> elements are moved in front of
      the enclosing <figure> element.

   o  <xref> elements inside <artwork> are expanded just like in regular
      text (that is, the markup is stripped, but the element is replaced
      by the applicable replacement text).

   o  <x:anchor-alias> elements get stripped.

   o  <x:bcp14> elements get stripped.

   o  <x:bb>, <x:bc> and <x:bt> elements get stripped.

   o  <x:blockquote> elements get converted to indented text (through a
      <list> element).

   o  <x:dfn> elements get stripped.

   o  <x:h> elements get stripped.

   o  <x:link> elements get stripped.

   o  <x:note> elements get converted to indented text (through a <list>
      element).

   o  <x:q> elements get stripped, with apostrophes added around the
      text.

   o  <x:ref> elements get replaced by <xref> elements, targetting
      either the anchor or another anchor with matching <x:anchor-alias>
      child element.

11.5.  Extracting artwork

   With "extract-artwork.xslt", artwork elements named through the
   "name" attribute can be extracted.  This can be used to automatically
   check their syntax (for instance, when ABNFs appear within a figure

   element).

   For instance:
   saxon rfc3986.xml extract-artwork.xslt name=uri.abnf

   In addition, artwork of a specific type can be extracted, such as
   with:
   saxon rfc3986.xml extract-artwork.xslt type=abnf

   When extracting by type, artwork elements with a specified name can
   be excluded; this can be handy when the document uses some kind of
   schema language, and an appendix contains the collected schema,
   repeating definitions from earlier on.  Example:
   saxon rfc3986.xml extract-artwork.xslt type=abnf except-name=clschm

11.6.  GRRDL

   "rfc2629grddl.xslt" extracts RDF information.  This is experimental
   work-in-progress.  See <http://www.w3.org/TR/grddl/> for more
   information.

Appendix C.  Examples

C.1.  Using the 'Internal Subset'

   The prolog of the XML document can both be used to refer to an
   external DTD, and also to define internal entities (Section 2.8 of
   [XML]):

   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <?xml-stylesheet type='text/xsl' href='rfc2629.xslt' ?>

   <!DOCTYPE rfc SYSTEM "rfc2629.dtd" [

     <!-- use "&MAY;" for a BCP 14 "MAY", see Section 10.3 -->
     <!ENTITY MAY
     "<bcp14 xmlns='http://purl.org/net/xml2rfc/ext'>MAY</bcp14>">

     <!-- re-declare "&nbsp;" as code point 160 (non-breaking space) -->
     <!-- you may need this for UAs that do not read external DTDs -->
     <!ENTITY nbsp
     "&#160;">

     <!-- allow later RFC2616 reference using "&rfc2616;" -->
     "http://xml.resource.org/public/rfc/bibxml/reference.RFC.2616.xml">

   ]>

   Note: including entities from a remote site will not work in Firefox,
   see <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22942>.

C.2.  Customization

   The XSLT code can be customized by creating a custom XSLT file that
   uses <xsl:import> to include the original code, and just overrides
   particular rules.
















Reschke                                                        [Page 48]

Documentation             RFC2629 through XSLT              January 2010


   For instance, the code below overrides several attributes in
   "rfc2629toFO.xslt", changing the color, spacing and font family for
   headers.

   <xsl:transform xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
                  version="1.0">

     <xsl:import href="rfc2629toFO.xslt"/>

     <xsl:attribute-set name="h1">
       <xsl:attribute name="color">darkblue</xsl:attribute>
       <xsl:attribute name="font-family">sans-serif</xsl:attribute>
       <xsl:attribute name="space-before">24pt</xsl:attribute>
     </xsl:attribute-set>

     <xsl:attribute-set name="h2">
       <xsl:attribute name="color">darkblue</xsl:attribute>
       <xsl:attribute name="font-family">sans-serif</xsl:attribute>
       <xsl:attribute name="space-before">18pt</xsl:attribute>
       <xsl:attribute name="space-after">3pt</xsl:attribute>
     </xsl:attribute-set>

     <xsl:attribute-set name="h3">
       <xsl:attribute name="color">darkblue</xsl:attribute>
       <xsl:attribute name="font-family">sans-serif</xsl:attribute>
       <xsl:attribute name="space-before">16pt</xsl:attribute>
       <xsl:attribute name="space-after">2pt</xsl:attribute>
     </xsl:attribute-set>

   </xsl:transform>

      Note: the name for the attribute sets may change in the future as
      more working is done with respect to customizability.  In any
      case, overriding the settings in a separate file will be easier to
      maintain.  Please contact the author if you find yourself trying
      to override style definitions that currently do not use attribute
      sets.

      Note: the CSS style information used in "rfc2629.xslt" can be
      overriden in a similar (but less granular) way: just overwrite the
      template called "insertCss".  As for XSL-FO, the class names may
      change in future.

Appendix D.  The /rfc/@ipr Attribute

   The "ipr" specifies what kind of text is generated for the "Status Of
   This Memo" and "Copyright Notice" sections on the front page.  When
   submitting an Internet Draft, the "boilerplate" is checked for
   compliance with the current Intellectual Property rules, and thus
   it's important to set the correct value.

   As of December 2009, the attribute value can take a long list of
   values.  As frequently, this is not the result of a grand plan, but
   simply for historic reasons.  Of these values, only a few are
   currently in use; all others are supported by the various tools for
   backwards compatibility with old source files.

      Note: some variations of the boilerplate are selected based on the
      document's date; therefore it is important to specify the "year",
      "month" and "date" attributes when archiving the XML source of an
      Internet Draft on the day of submission.

   _Disclaimer: THIS ONLY PROVIDES IMPLEMENTATION INFORMATION.  IF YOU
   NEED LEGAL ADVICE, PLEASE CONTACT A LAWYER._ For further information,
   refer to <http://trustee.ietf.org/docs/IETF-Copyright-FAQ.pdf>.

D.1.  Current Values: '*trust200902'

   The name for these values refers to the "TLP" ("IETF TRUST Legal
   Provisions Relating to IETF Documents"), on effect February 15, 2009
   (see <http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info/archive/
   IETF-Trust-License-Policy-02-16-09.pdf>).  An update to this document
   was published on September 12, 2009 (<http://trustee.ietf.org/
   license-info/archive/IETF-Trust-License-Policy-20090912.pdf>),
   modifying the license for code components.  The actual text is
   located in Section 6 ("Text To Be Included in IETF Documents") of
   these documents.

   The tools will automatically produce the "right" text depending on
   the document's date information (see above).

      Note: for consistency with Internet Draft generation using
      xml2rfc.tcl, the TLP text effective since December 28, 2009 is
      currently only supported when producing RFCs.

D.1.1.  trust200902

   This should be the default, unless one of the more specific
   '*trust200902' values is a better fit.  It produces the text in
   Sections 6.a and 6.b of the TLP.

Documentation             RFC2629 through XSLT              January 2010


D.1.2.  noModificationTrust200902

   This produces the additional text from Section 6.c.i of the TLP.

      This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may
      not be created, except to format it for publication as an RFC or
      to translate it into languages other than English.

D.1.3.  noDerivativesTrust200902

   This produces the additional text from Section 6.c.ii of the TLP.

      This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may
      not be created, and it may not be published except as an Internet-
      Draft.

D.1.4.  pre5378Trust200902

   This produces the additional text from Section 6.c.iii of the TLP,
   frequently called the "pre-5378 escape clause":

      This document may contain material from IETF Documents or IETF
      Contributions published or made publicly available before November
      10, 2008.  The person(s) controlling the copyright in some of this
      material may not have granted the IETF Trust the right to allow
      modifications of such material outside the IETF Standards Process.
      Without obtaining an adequate license from the person(s)
      controlling the copyright in such materials, this document may not
      be modified outside the IETF Standards Process, and derivative
      works of it may not be created outside the IETF Standards Process,
      except to format it for publication as an RFC or to translate it
      into languages other than English.

   See Section 4 of
   <http://trustee.ietf.org/docs/IETF-Copyright-FAQ.pdf> for further
   information about when to use this value.

      Note: this text appears under "Copyright Notice", unless the
      document was published before November 2009, in which case it
      appears under "Status Of This Memo".

D.2.  Historic Values

D.2.1.  Historic Values: '*trust200811'

   The attribute values "trust200811", "noModificationTrust200811" and
   "noDerivativesTrust200811" are similar to their "trust200902"
   counterparts, except that they use text specified in <http://

D.2.2.  Historic Values: '*3978'

   The attribute values "full3978", "noModification3978" and
   "noDerivatives3978" are similar to their counterparts above, except
   that they use text specified in RFC 3978 (March 2005).

D.2.3.  Historic Values: '*3667'

   The attribute values "full3667", "noModification3667" and
   "noDerivatives3667" are similar to their counterparts above, except
   that they use text specified in RFC 3667 (February 2004).

D.2.4.  Historic Values: '*2026'

   The attribute values "full2026" and "noDerivativeWorks2026" are
   similar to their counterparts above, except that they use text
   specified in RFC 2026 (October 1996).

   The special value "none" was also used back then, and denied the IETF
   any rights beyond publication as Internet Draft.
