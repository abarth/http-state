1.  Introduction

   This is a package to convert memos written in XML to the RFC format.

   If you don't want to install any software, you can use the web-based
   service [4].

2.  Requirements

   You need to have Tcl/Tk version 8 running on your system.  Tcl is a
   scripting language, Tk is Tcl with support for your windowing system.

   To get a source or binary distribution for your system, go to the Tcl
   Developer Xchange website [5] and install it.  If you get the binary
   distribution, this is pretty simple.

   Of course, you may already have Tcl version 8.  To find out, try
   typing this command from the shell (or the "MS-DOS Prompt"):

       % tclsh

   If the program launches, you're good to go with Tcl version 8.

   If you are running under a windowing system (e.g., X or MS-Windows),
   you can also try:

       % wish

   If a new window comes up along with a "Console" window, then you're
   good to go with Tk version 8.

   Finally, you may notice a file called "xml2sgml.tcl" in the
   distribution.  It contains some extra functionality for a few special
   users -- so, if you don't know what it is, don't worry about it...

3.  Testing

   Now test your installation.

3.1.  Testing under a windowing system

   Type this command from the shell:

       % xml2rfc.tcl

   A new window should come up that looks like this:

       +------------------------------------------------------------+
       |                     Convert XML to RFC                     |
       |                                                            |
       |  Select input file: ____________________________  [Browse] |
       |                                                            |
       | Select output file: ____________________________  [Browse] |
       |                                                            |
       |               [Convert]               [Quit]               |
       |                                                            |
       +------------------------------------------------------------+

   Fill-in the blanks and click on [Convert].

3.2.  Testing without a windowing system

   Type this command from the shell:

       % tclsh

   If the program launches, type this command to it:

       % source xml2rfc.tcl

   and you should see these five lines:

       invoke as "xml2rfc   input-file output-file"
              or "xml2txt   input-file"
              or "xml2html  input-file"
              or "xml2nroff input-file"
              or "xml2unpg  input-file"

4.  Next steps

   Read the 2629bis [6] document.  In particular, Section 3 has some
   good information.

4.1.  Processing Instructions

   A _processing instruction_ contains directives to an XML application.
   If you want to give directives to *xml2rfc*, the processing
   instructions (PIs) look like this:

       <?rfc keyword='value'?>

   Of course, if you like the default behavior, you don't need any
   behavior-modifying directives in your input file!  Although *xml2rfc*
   supports putting several attribute-like directives in one PI, be
   warned that rfc2629.xslt (Appendix B) does not support it and that
   there are issues in doing this for a non-include-file directive
   following an include-file directive (Section 4.1.2).  It is good
   practice to always surround the value with either single or double
   quotes.

4.1.1.  Option Settings

   The list of valid keywords are:

   +---------------------+--------------+------------------------------+
   |             keyword |    default   | meaning                      |

   +---------------------+--------------+------------------------------+

   Remember that, as with everything else in XML, keywords and values
   are case-sensitive.

   With the exception of the "needLines", "typeout", and "include"
   directives, you normally put all of these processing instructions at
   the beginning of the document (right after the XML declaration).

4.1.2.  Include Files

   *xml2rfc* has an include-file facility, e.g.,

       <?rfc include='file'?>

   *xml2rfc* will consult the "XML_LIBRARY" environment variable for a
   search path of where to look for files.  (If this environment
   variable isn't set, the directory containing the file that contains
   the include-file directive is used.)  The file's contents are
   inserted right after the PI.  Putting non-include-file directives
   (especially needLines ones) after an include-file one in the same PI
   may not work as expected because of this.  Remember that file names
   are generally case-sensitive and that an input file that is
   distributed to the outside world may be processed on a different
   operating system than that used by its author.

README                      xml2rfc v1.34pre3              February 2009


   You can also have *xml2rfc* set the "XML_LIBRARY" environment
   variable directly, by creating a file called ".xml2rfc.rc" in the
   directory where your main file is, e.g.,

   global env tcl_platform

   if {![string compare $tcl_platform(platform) windows]} {
       set sep ";"
   } else {
       set sep ":"
   }

   if {[catch { set env(XML_LIBRARY) } library]} {
       set library ""
       foreach bibxmlD [lsort -dictionary \
                              [glob -nocomplain $HOME/rfcs/bibxml/*]] {
           append library $sep$bibxmlD
       }
   }

   set nativeD [file nativename $inputD]
   if {[lsearch [split $library $sep] $nativeD] < 0} {
       set library "$nativeD$sep$library"
   }

   set env(XML_LIBRARY) $library

   There are links to various bibliographic databases (RFCs, I-Ds, and
   so on) on the *xml2rfc* homepage [4].

5.  The Page Model

   The *html* rendering engine does not need to have a tightly defined
   page model.

   The *txt* and *nr* rendering engines assume the following page model.

   Each line has at most 72 columns from the left edge, including any
   left margin, but excluding the line terminator.  Every output
   character is from the ASCII repertoire and the only control character
   used is the line-feed (LF); the character-tabulation (HT) character
   is never used.

   Each page has the following lines (in 1-based numbering, as reported
   to the user, but contrary to *xml2rfc*'s internal 0-based numbering):

       1: header line (blank line on first page)

       2: blank line

       3: blank line

       4: 1st line of content

      ...

      51: 48th line of content

      52: blank line

      53: blank line

      54: blank line

      55: footer line

      56: form-feed character (followed by line terminator)

   Once processed through *nroff* and the "fix.sh" script (from
   2-nroff.template [7]), the *nr* output differs from this in two ways.
   It has three extra blank lines (that could be numbered -2, -1, and 0,
   for a total of six) at the very beginning of the document (so the
   first page is that much longer).  It also has no line terminator
   following the very last form-feed character of the file.  These
   differences originate in the design of the "fix.sh" script.

   Header and footer lines each have three parts: left, center, and
   right.

6.  Additions to RFC 2629

   A few additions have been made to the format originally defined in
   RFC 2629.  In particular, Appendix C of the 2629bis document
   enumerates the additions.

6.1.  Extra Attributes

   In addition, *xml2rfc* recognizes the undocumented "src", "alt",
   "width", and "height" attributes in the "figure" and "artwork"
   elements, but only if HTML is being generated.  Here are two
   examples, one for each case.

   Here, the attributes are added to the "artwork" element.

             <figure>
                 <preamble>This is the preamble.</preamble>
                 <artwork src='layers.png'
                          alt='[picture of layers only]'>
             .-----------.
             | ASCII art |
             `-----------'
             </artwork>
                 <postamble>This is the postamble.</postamble>
             </figure>

   In this case, the "preamble" and "postamble" elements are kept and an
   "img" tag is placed in the HTML output to replace the whole "artwork"
   element and its textual drawing, which are ignored.

   Here, the attributes are added to the "figure" element.

             <figure src='layers.png'
                     alt='[picture of layers and explanation]'>
                 <preamble>This is the preamble.</preamble>
                 <artwork>
             .-----------.
             | ASCII art |
             `-----------'
             </artwork>
                 <postamble>This is the postamble.</postamble>
             </figure>

   In this case, an "img" tag is placed in the HTML output to replace
   the whole contents of the "figure" element (the "preamble",
   "artwork", and "postamble" inner elements and the textual drawing
   itself) which are ignored.

   *xml2rfc* also recognizes an undocumented "align" attribute (with
   possible values "left", "center", or "right") in the "figure" and
   "artwork" elements.  It affects the whole content of the targeted
   element for all types of generated output.  Its default is inherited
   from the parent of its element.

6.2.  Typed-Artwork Interpretation

   The "artwork" element from RFC 2629 supports an optional "type"
   attribute.  While most possible values are just ignored, including
   the special case where the attribute is unspecified or just empty,
   some values are recognized.  In particular, "type='abnf'" can be used
   if the "artwork" contains an Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) syntax
   specification [3].  As a special extension in its _behavior_,
   *xml2rfc* will attempt to validate the syntax and colorize the HTML
   output of ABNF, since it is so widely used in RFCs.  It does this
   colorizing by relying on the full parsing it does right before, not
   on a quick and partial (e.g., line-by-line) pattern-based hack.  ABNF
   is the only artwork type to benefit from this kind of internal
   support at this time.  If the "strict" rfc-PI directive is activated,
   invalid ABNF content will cause *xml2rfc* to abort with an error
   message.  Omitting the "type" attribute altogether is the obvious way
   to avoid having this validation and colorizing performed.

   For example (to be viewed in HTML):

         char-val       =  DQUOTE *(%x20-21 / %x23-7E) DQUOTE
                                ; quoted string of SP and VCHAR
                                   without DQUOTE

         num-val        =  "%" (bin-val / dec-val / hex-val)

         bin-val        =  "b" 1*BIT
                           [ 1*("." 1*BIT) / ("-" 1*BIT) ]
                                ; series of concatenated bit values
                                ; or single ONEOF range

         dec-val        =  "d" 1*DIGIT
                           [ 1*("." 1*DIGIT) / ("-" 1*DIGIT) ]

         hex-val        =  "x" 1*HEXDIG
                           [ 1*("." 1*HEXDIG) / ("-" 1*HEXDIG) ]

         prose-val      =  "<" *(%x20-3D / %x3F-7E) ">"
                                ; bracketed string of SP and VCHAR
                                   without angles
                                ; prose description, to be used as
                                   last resort

   This is from the original RFC on ABNF [2], with its minor mistakes in
   manually folded comment lines purposely left intact, for
   illustration.  Since the result is still valid ABNF (but incorrect
   with respect to what was intended), this showcases how colorizing
   might give a human author (or editor or reader) a better chance to
   spot the three mistakes (and correct them, e.g., with extra
   semicolons, as has been done in a more recent version [3] of the ABNF
   specification).  Note that it is the white space characters at the
   beginning of the subsequent lines (including the commented ones) that
   conspire to extend the reach of those rules across several lines.

7.  Limitations of xml2rfc

   o  The "figure" element's "title" attribute is ignored, except when
      generating HTML.

   o  The "xref" element's "pageno" attribute is ignored.

Appendix A.  MacOS 9 Installation (courtesy of Ned Freed)

   1.  Install Tcl/Tk 8.3.4

   2.  When you performed Step 1, a folder in your "Extensions" folder
       called "Tool Command Language" was created.  Create a new folder
       under "Extensions", with any name you like.

   3.  Drag the file "xml2rfc.tcl" onto the "Drag & Drop Tclets"
       application that was installed in Step 1.

   4.  When asked for an appropriate "wish" stub, select "Wish 8.3.4".

   5.  The "Drag & Drop Tclets" application will write out an executable
       version of *xml2rfc*.

Appendix B.  rfc2629.xslt (courtesy of Julian Reschke)

   The file "rfc2629.xslt" can be used with an XSLT-capable formatter
   (e.g., Saxon, Xalan, xsltproc, or MSIE6) to produce HTML.  A word of
   warning though: the XSLT script only supports a limited subset of the
   processing instruction directives discussed earlier (Section 4.1) and
   each attribute-like directive must be in its own PI (i.e., "<?rfc
   keyword='value'?>").  The latest version [8] (and full distribution
   ZIP file [9]) can be downloaded from the original site which also
   hosts its documentation [10].

Appendix C.  MS-Windows XP/Cygwin Installation (courtesy of Joe Touch)

   1.  install Cygwin: follow instructions at the Cygwin website [11]
       (also visit the Cygwin pages on the Tcl Wiki [12]), make sure to
       select "tcltk" in "Libs"

   2.  place a copy of xml2rfc files on a local drive, e.g., in
       "C:\xml2rfc" NOTE: for xml2rfc-1.26 and earlier, see NOTE below.

   3.  place a copy of bibxml* files on a local drive, e.g., in
       "C:\xmlbib\"

   4.  edit ".xml2rfc.rc" to indicate the "bibxml*" library path, e.g.,
       as per Step 3, change "~/rfca/bibxml/*" to "/cygdrive/c/xmlbib/*"

   5.  run xml2rfc as follows: "tclsh /cygdrive/c/xml2rfc/xml2rfc.tcl"

   NOTE: for xml2rfc-1.26 and earlier ONLY, add an additional
   modification in Step 3:

      Patch ".xml2rfc.rc" (xml2rfc-1.26 and earlier).  The purpose of
      the patch is to append library names in a format compatible with
      the OS; on MS-Windows XP, this replaces the Cygwin's "/" with MS-
      Windows' "\".
