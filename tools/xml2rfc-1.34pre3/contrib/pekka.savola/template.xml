<note title="Foreword">
	<t>SEE RFC2629(bis) FOR MORE INFORMATION:
http://xml.resource.org/public/rfc/html/rfc2629.html and "bis":
http://xml.resource.org/authoring/draft-mrose-writing-rfcs.html.  Also see
http://xml.resource.org/authoring/README.html for for 'rfc' option
strings.</t>
	<t>Please also remember to check out
http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html for issues to note when writing
drafts.</t>
	<t>Remember, you don't need to have any other tools than a 'notepad'
or your favourite editor to write xml2rfc drafts.  You can use the web
interface at http://xml.resource.org for processing.  The benefit of using
xml editors is mostly catching those missing tags which the processor will
warn you about, but you don't need to worry about the editors when getting
started.</t>
	<t>This template is not meant to be a conclusive list of everything,
but summarize the often-needed basic features to get one started.</t>
</note>



<section title="Introduction">
	<t>Now you can have a bit more lengthier text here.</t>
	<t>Let's refer to a couple of documents: <xref
target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-3gpp-analysis"/> and <xref
target="RFC2661">L2TP</xref>.  For text generation, these look equivalent,
but the latter looks a bit neater in the HTML representation.</t>
	<t>You might also add a note about the usage of RFC2119 keywords here..</t>
	<t>You can cross-reference the sections in a stable manner; <xref
target="sect2"/></t>.
</section>



<section anchor="sect2" title="Sections go under here..">
	<t>There are multiple list styles: 'symbols', 'letters', 'numbers',
'hanging', 'format', etc.</t>
	<list style="symbols">
		<t>First bullet</t>
		<t>Second bullet</t>
	</list>
	<t>One can draw fancy diagrams as well; remember to ensure that they
don't exceed 72 chars/line.</t>
	<!-- you can specify how many contiguous lines you need (w/o linebreak you need -->

	<t>Note that including a CDATA you don't need to escape most special characters
you might otherwise have to.</t>
	<section title="A Subsection">
		<t>There can be a lot of subsections.  By default 3 levels of
nesting show in ToC but that can be adjusted.</t>

<section title="Decrypting XML2RFC Parsing errors">
	<t>The most common form of xml2rfc parsing erros are those where a
closing tag has been expected to be present before a new kind of tag is
specified.  In the example below, Introduction section's last paragraph was
missing the closing t-element.  The rest of the error messages can be rather
easily understood as well by reading it carefully and examining the context. 
The reason is typically a missing tag somewhere.</t>
