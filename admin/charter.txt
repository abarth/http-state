Description of Working Group:

The HTTP State Management Mechanism (aka Cookies) was originally
created by Netscape Communications in their informal Netscape cookie
specification ("cookie_spec.html"), from which formal specifications
RFC 2109 and RFC 2965 evolved.  The formal specifications, however,
were never fully implemented in practice; RFC 2109, in addition to
cookie_spec.html, more closely resemble real-world implementations
than RFC 2965, even though RFC 2965 officially obsoletes the former.
Compounding the problem are undocumented features (such as HTTPOnly),
and varying behaviors among real-world implementations.

The working group will create a new RFC that:
 * obsoletes RFC 2109,
 * updates RFC 2965 to the extent it overlaps or voids RFC 2109, and
 * specifies Cookies as they are actually used in existing implementations
   and deployments.

Where commonalities exist in the most widely used implementations, the working
group will specify the common behavior.  Where differences exist among the most
widely used implementations, the working group will document the variations and
seek consensus to reduce variation by selecting among the most widely used
variations.

The working group must not introduce any new syntax or new semantics
not already in common use.

The working group's specific deliverables are:
* A standards-track document that is suitable to supersede RFC 2109 (likely
  based on draft-abarth-cookie)
* An informational document cataloguing the differences between major
  implementations

In doing so, the working group should consider:

* cookie_spec.html - Netscape Cookie Specification
   http://web.archive.org/web/20070805052634/http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html
* RFC 2109 - HTTP State Management Mechanism (Obsoleted by RFC 2965)
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2109
* RFC 2964 - Use of HTTP State Management
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2964
* RFC 2965 - HTTP State Management Mechanism (Obsoletes RFC 2109)
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2965
* I-D - HTTP State Management Mechanism v2
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pettersen-cookie-v2
* I-D - Cookie-based HTTP Authentication
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-broyer-http-cookie-auth
* Widely Implemented - HTTPOnly
   http://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTPOnly
* Browser Security Handbook - Cookies
