Description of Working Group:

The HTTP State Management Mechanism (aka Cookies) was originally
created by Netscape Communications in their informal Netscape cookie
specification ("cookie_spec.html"), from which formal specifications
RFC 2109 and RFC 2965 evolved.  The formal specifications, however,
were never fully implemented in practice; RFC 2109, in addition to
cookie_spec.html, more closely resemble real-world implementations
than RFC 2965, even though RFC 2965 officially obsoletes the former.
Compounding the problem are undocumented features (such as HTTPOnly),
and widely varying behaviors among real-world implementations.

The working group will create a new RFC that obsoletes RFC 2965 and
specifies Cookies as they are actually used in existing
implementations and deployments.  Where differences exist among the
most common implementations, the working group will document the
variations and provide a recommended choice for updates and new
implementations.  This will also facilitate interoperability among
existing implementations if they so choose.
